Its supporters held a protest rally in Athens.Many displayed banners, held crosses, read prayers and sang passages from the Bible in the capital's Syntagma Square.The head of the Orthodox Church, Archbishop Ieronymos, said the measure would ""corrupt the homeland's social cohesion"".The bill needed a simple majority to pass through the 300-member parliament.Mr Mitsotakis had championed the bill but required the support of opposition parties to get it over the line, with dozens of MPs from his centre-right governing party opposed. ""People who have been invisible will finally be made visible around us, and with them, many children will finally find their rightful place,"" the prime minister told parliament during a debate ahead of the vote. ""The reform makes the lives of several of our fellow citizens better, without taking away anything from the lives of the many.""Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Opponents of the legislature held a protest rally in front of the parliament building in AthensThe vote has been welcomed by LGBTQ organisations in Greece.""This is a historic moment,"" Stella Belia, the head of same-sex parents' group Rainbow Families, told Reuters news agency. ""This is a day of joy."" Fifteen of the European Union's 27 members have already legalised same-sex marriage. It is permitted in 35 countries worldwide.Greece has until now lagged behind some of its European neighbours, largely because of opposition from the Church. It is the first country in south-eastern Europe to have marriage equality.Related TopicsGreeceMarriageLGBTMore on this storyCheers in Athens as same-sex marriage becomes law.

Another 76 rejected the reform while two abstained from the vote and 46 were not present.Members of the LGBTQ+ community, many unable to contain their emotion, watched from the galleries above.“We have waited years for this,” said the prominent gay activist Stella Belia of legislation that will not only allow same-sex couples to exchange vows in civil ceremonies but also to adopt children.“It’s a historic moment. A lot of us weren’t sure it would ever come,” she said.The vote followed two days of heated debate – and weeks of public rancour – with the reform described by supporters as “bold” and “long overdue” and decried as “antisocial’ and “unchristian” by opponents including the powerful Orthodox church.Despite facing formidable pushback from within his own centre-right New Democracy party, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis had championed the bill, saying it would end a “serious inequality for our democracy”.‘A brilliant start’: gay Greeks eager for MPs to legalise same-sex marriageRead moreIn an impassioned speech before the vote, the 55-year-old leader, who belongs to the liberal faction of his party, said the measure would align Greece with 36 countries globally that had already legislated on the issue. Conservatism, he argued, should not be conflated with antiquated views that were out of sync with modern society.“The reform that we are legislating today … will make the life of some of our fellow citizens that much better without – and I emphasise this – taking away anything from the lives of the many,” said Mitsotakis, adding that the law would confer full parental rights on same-sex couples.“We are covering a gap by allowing everyone, if they wish, to institutionally seal their relationship … just as heterosexual couples do.”But resistance had been strong from New Democracy MPs aware of their constituents in the socially conservative nation.Highlighting the opposition, the former prime minister Antonis Samaras had told parliament earlier on Thursday that same-sex marriage was not a human right and the “dangerous” law should not have been introduced.Without the backing of Syriza, the main opposition leftist party led by Stefanos Kasselakis, Greece’s first gay political leader, and other smaller groups, the reform would not have passed.Marriage equality mapYet while three opposition parties voted in favour, the law also faced criticism for not going far enough. Describing the bill as “imperfect”, Syriza deplored the fact that it still banned same-sex couples from achieving parenthood through surrogacy – an option Kasselakis has acknowledged he would like to pursue with his American husband, Tyler McBeth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All four insisted that if they had their way, the “monstrous” legislation would be nullified.But Mitsotakis insisted that as of Friday barriers would be removed.For far too long, he said, gay people had remained “invisible,” oppressed by their families and social environment in villages and towns. “They were, let’s not kid ourselves, the children of a lesser god,” he told MPs, visibly moved.Within minutes of the vote’s passage on Thursday night, the Greek leader posted on X: “The vote has passed: as of tonight Greece is proud to become the 16th EU country to legislate marriage equality.“This is a milestone for human rights, reflecting today’s Greece – a progressive and democratic country, passionately committed to European values.”Explore more on these topicsEqual marriageGreeceLGBTQ+ rightsEuropenewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this story‘This is where I apologise’: Polish state TV presenter says sorry to LGBT+ viewers3d agoRussia hands out first convictions in connection with anti-LGBT law1 Feb 2024Ugandan LGBTQ+ activist in critical condition after brutal knife attack3 Jan 2024LGBTQ+ couple in Nepal are first in south Asia to be legally married30 Nov 2023Russia files lawsuit to crack down on LGBTQ+ community17 Nov 2023Hungary sacks museum chief for not enforcing under-18s ban at LGBTQ+ exhibition7 Nov 2023Japan court rules mandatory sterilisation of people officially changing gender unconstitutional25 Oct 2023Greece’s gay Syriza leader says he told of plans to become parent to ‘stir’ debate7 Oct 2023Most viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

""This is a day of joy.""The bill was approved by 176 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament and will become law when its published in the official government gazette. ALSO READ Greeks protest against same-sex marriage and adoption reform Although members of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' centre-right New Democracy party abstained or voted against the bill, it gained enough support from the leftist opposition in a rare show of cross-party unity despite a tense debate.""Its a very important step for human rights, a very important step for equality, and a very important step for Greek society,"" said 40-year-old Nikos Nikolaidis, a historian who joined a rally in favour of the bill ahead of the vote.Recent opinion polls show Greeks are split on the issue. The powerful Orthodox Church, which believes homosexuality is a sin, has strongly opposed same-sex marriage, while many in the LGBT community believe the bill does not go far enough.It does not overturn obstacles for LGBT couples in using assisted reproduction methods. Surrogate pregnancies will also not be extended to LGBT individuals, though the bill recognises children already born through that method abroad.Elliniki Lysi, one of the three far-right parties represented in parliament, called the bill ""anti-Christian"" and said it hurts national interests.Former Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, a New Democracy lawmaker, said: ""Of course I will vote against it. The marriage of same-sex couples... is not a human right.""Proud to be GreekLGBT groups rallied outside parliament. A banner read: ""Not a step back from real equality.""""I'm very proud as a Greek citizen because Greece is actually - now - one of the most progressive countries,"" said Ermina Papadima, a member of the Greek Transgender Support Association.""I think the mindset is going to change... We have to wait, but I think the laws are going to help with that.""Campaigners have been pushing for change for decades, often against the tide of the Church and right wing politicians. In 2008, a lesbian and a gay couple defied the law and married on the tiny island of Tilos, but their weddings were later annulled by a top court.But there have been some steps in recent years. In 2015, Greece allowed civil partnership among same-sex couples, and in 2017 it gave legal recognition to gender identity. Two years ago it banned conversion therapy for minors aimed at suppressing a person's sexual orientation.

(AP Photo/Michael Varaklas) Share ATHENS - Greece on Thursday became the first Orthodox Christian country to legalize same-sex civil marriage, despite opposition from the influential, socially conservative Greek Church. A cross-party majority of 176 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament voted late Thursday in favor of the landmark bill drafted by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' centre-right government. Another 76 rejected the reform while two abstained from the vote and 46 were not present in the house. Download the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories Mitsotakis tweeted after the vote that Greece ""is proud to become the 16th (European Union) country to legislate marriage equality."" ""This is a milestone for human rights, reflecting today's Greece -- a progressive, and democratic country, passionately committed to European values,"" he wrote. Scores of supporters of the reform who had gathered outside parliament and were watching the debate on a screen cheered loudly and hugged as the vote result was announced. “This took a long time to be adopted in our country … but at least it happened and that’s what is important,” said a man who only gave his first name, Nikolas. “We are no longer invisible.” Earlier, people opposed to the bill had also protested nearby, holding prayer books and religious icons. Opinion polls suggest that most Greeks support the reform by a narrow margin, and the issue has failed to trigger deep divisions in a country more worried about the high cost of living. The bill was backed by four left-wing parties, including the main opposition Syriza. ""This law doesn't solve every problem, but it is a beginning,"" said Spiros Bibilas, a lawmaker from the small left-wing Passage to Freedom party, who is openly gay. It was approved despite several majority and left-wing lawmakers abstaining or voting against the reform. Three small far-right parties and the Stalinist-rooted Communist Party rejected the draft law from the start of the two-day debate. ""People who have been invisible will finally be made visible around us. And with them, many children (will) finally find their rightful place,"" Mitsotakis told lawmakers ahead of the evening vote. “Both parents of same-sex couples do not yet have the same legal opportunities to provide their children with what they need,"" he added. ""To be able to pick them up from school, to be able to travel, to go to the doctor, or take them to the hospital. ... That is what we are fixing.” The bill confers full parental rights on married same-sex partners with children. But it precludes gay couples from parenthood through surrogate mothers in Greece -- an option currently available to women who can't have children for health reasons. Greece Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' center-right government is poised to make Greece the first Orthodox Christian-majority country to approve marriage equality legislation. (AP Photo/Michael Varaklas) Many LGBTQ2S+ rights advocates have criticized that limitation, as well as the absence of any provision for transgender people. Psychologist Nancy Papathanasiou, scientific co-director of Orlando LGBT+, which advocates for LGBTQI mental health, echoed that concern but said the new law confers a very important sense of equality. “Discrimination is the most pervasive risk factor for mental health,” she said. “So just knowing that there is less discrimination is protective and promotive for LGBTQI mental health.” Maria Syrengela, a lawmaker from the governing New Democracy, or ND, said the reform redresses a long-standing injustice for same-sex couples and their children. ""And let's reflect on what these people have been through, spending so many years in the shadows, entangled in bureaucratic procedures,"" she said. 5 Things to Know newsletter: Sign up to start your day with the top stories Dissidents among the governing party included former Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, from ND's conservative wing. ""Same-sex marriage is not a human right ... and it's not an international obligation for our country,"" he told parliament. ""Children have a right to have parents from both sexes."" Polls show that while most Greeks agree to same-sex weddings they also reject extending parenthood through surrogacy to male couples. Same-sex civil partnerships have been allowed in Greece since 2015. But that only conferred legal guardianship to the biological parents of children in those relationships, leaving their partners in a bureaucratic limbo. The main opposition to the new bill has come from the traditionalist Church of Greece -- which also disapproves of heterosexual civil marriage. Church officials have centred their criticism on the bill's implications for traditional family values, and argue that potential legal challenges could lead to a future extension of surrogacy rights to gay couples. Church supporters and conservative organizations have staged small protests against the proposed law. Far-right lawmaker Vassilis Stigas, head of the small Spartans party, described the legislation Thursday as ""sick"" and claimed that its adoption would ""open the gates of Hell and perversion."" Politically, the same-sex marriage law is not expected to harm Mitsotakis' government, which won easy re-election last year after capturing much of the centrist vote. A stronger challenge comes from ongoing protests by farmers angry at high production costs, and intense opposition from many students to the planned scrapping of a state monopoly on university education. Nevertheless, parliament is expected to approve the university bill later this month, and opinion polls indicate that most Greeks support it. Associated Press reporters Derek Gatopoulos, Michael Varaklas and Theodora Tongas in Athens contributed to this report.

For those that don't sell in time, most stores try to donate them to food banks rather than throw them away.

Read our privacy noticeGreece has become the first majority-Orthodox Christian nation to legalise same-sex marriage under civil law. And at least for the near future, it will almost certainly be the only one.A cross-party majority of 176 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament voted on Thursday in favor of the landmark bill drafted by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis ‘ center-right government. Another 76 rejected the reform while two abstained from the vote and 46 were not present in the house.Mitsotakis tweeted after the vote that Greece “is proud to become the 16th (European Union) country to legislate marriage equality.”“This is a milestone for human rights, reflecting today’s Greece — a progressive, and democratic country, passionately committed to European values,” he wrote.Eastern Orthodox leadership, despite lacking a single doctrinal authority like a pope, has been united in opposing recognition of same-sex relationships both within its own rites and in the civil realm. Public opinion in majority Orthodox countries has mostly been opposed, too.But there are some signs of change. Two small majority-Orthodox countries, Montenegro and Cyprus, have authorized same-sex unions in recent years, as did Greece in 2015 before upgrading to this week’s approval of full marital status.FILE - A protester raises a banner during a rally against same-sex marriage, at central Syntagma square, in Athens (Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved)Civil unions may become more common among Orthodox countries gravitating toward the European Union. They remain off the table in Russia, which has cracked down on LGBTQ+ expression, and countries in its orbit.Following is a summary of church positions and public opinion in the Orthodox world, followed by the situation in individual majority-Orthodox lands.The Orthodox WorldEastern Orthodoxy is a socially conservative, ancient church with elaborate rituals and a strict hierarchy. Churches are mostly organized along national lines, with multiple independent churches that share ancient doctrine and practices and that both cooperate and squabble.Roughly 200 million Eastern Orthodox live primarily in Eastern Europe and neighboring Asian lands, with about half that total in Russia, while smaller numbers live across the world. Like other international church bodies, Orthodoxy has confronted calls for LGBTQ+ inclusion. A 2016 statement by a council of most Orthodox churches called marriage between a man and a woman “the oldest institution of divine law” and said members were forbidden from entering same-sex unions.FILE - Anti-gay protesters hold religious banners amid heavy police presence and during a Pride march in Belgrade, Serbia (Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)In countries where they are a majority, Orthodox believers overwhelmingly said society should not accept homosexuality or approve same-sex marriage, according to surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 by the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank.Greek Orthodox showed relative tolerance, with half of Orthodox saying homosexuality should be accepted and a quarter favoring same-sex marriage. In more recent polls, Greeks overall narrowly supported the marriage law.The Greek law validates marriage in the civil realm but doesn't require any church to perform such rites.Nevertheless, Greece’s Orthodox leadership unanimously opposed the law in January, saying the “duality of genders and their complementarity are not social inventions but originate from God.”Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged the church’s position but said, “We are discussing the decisions of the Greek state, unrelated to theological beliefs.”Civil unions may be in some Orthodox countries’ near future, said George Demacopoulos, director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University in New York. “In terms of civil marriage, I think the countries that are in the European Union will eventually all do it,” Demacopoulos said. “My guess is the assemblies of bishops in those countries will offer some resistance to the measure, and depending on where you are, that may or may not delay it.”UkraineIn Ukraine, same-sex couples cannot register their status legally.In 2023, the issue became acute as many LGBTQ+ people joined Ukraine’s armed forces. That year, a bill was introduced in Parliament to establish civil partnerships for same-sex couples, providing basic rights such as compensation if one of the partners is killed in action.The All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations — which includes Ukraine’s two rival Orthodox churches — opposed the draft law, contending that some international entities are using the country’s current vulnerability to force unwanted changes.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved)The legislation remains pending.The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2023 that Ukraine violated the rights of a same-sex couple who sought legal protections provided to married heterosexual couples.Ukraine is majority Orthodox, with various religious minorities.RussiaIn increasingly conservative Russia, President Vladimir Putin has forged a powerful alliance with the Russian Orthodox Church and has made “traditional family values” a cornerstone of his rule, juxtaposing them with “perversions” of the West.Putin effectively outlawed same-sex marriages in the 2020 constitutional revision that added a clause stipulating that marriage is a union of a man and a woman.In 2013, the Kremlin adopted what’s known as the “gay propaganda” law, banning any public endorsement of “nontraditional sexual relations” among minors.A gay rights activist stands with a rainbow flag, in front of journalists, during a protest in Russia (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved)After sending troops into Ukraine in 2022, Russian authorities ramped up a campaign against what it called the West’s “degrading” moral influence, in what rights advocates saw as an attempt to legitimize the war.Patriarch Kirill of Moscow has assailed LGBTQ+ rights. As head of the Russian Orthodox Church, he oversees the world's largest Orthodox flock. He depicted his country’s invasion of Ukraine as part of a metaphysical struggle against a liberal agenda that included “gay parades.”In November, Russia’s Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism, labeling what the government called the LGBTQ+ “international movement” as an extremist group and banning it in Russia. In 2021, a survey by Russia’s top independent pollster, the Levada Center, showed that only 33% of Russians completely or somewhat agree that gay men and women should enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals, a decrease from earlier years.BelarusBelarus’s Family Code defines marriage as a “union between a man and a woman.” There is also no legislation prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.Homosexuality was decriminalized in Belarus in 1994, but the LGBTQ+ community faces heavy stigma and high suicide rates, advocates say.Human rights groups report hundreds of cases of the KGB – the country’s main domestic security agency – trying to recruit gay people and threatening to out them.Serbia and MontenegroSerbia and Montenegro, two conservative Balkan nations where the Serbian Orthodox Church holds huge influence, have had mixed results addressing LGBTQ+ rights as part of efforts to join the European Union.Tiny Montenegro passed a bill in 2020 allowing same-sex partnerships — not marriage and with fewer rights. In Serbia, a similar draft law never made it to a parliamentary vote.FILE Men kiss during gay pride march in Podgorica, Montenegro (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)The Serbian Orthodox Church, which maintains close relations with the Russian church, has opposed the idea of same-sex marriages.Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic has said he would not sign off a bill on same-sex marriages, although Serbia has had an openly lesbian prime minister for years. Activists have been campaigning for legal partnerships.Pride marches in Serbia are routinely banned or held under tight security. In Montenegro, though same-sex partnerships are allowed, the highly male-oriented society of 620,000 people remains divided over the issue.Romania and MoldovaRomania is one of the few European Union members that allows neither same-sex marriage nor civil unions, despite a growing social acceptance of LGBTQ+ people.In 2023, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Romania had failed to enforce same-sex couples’ rights by not legally recognizing their relationships. In early February in Romania, LGBTQ+ activists were allegedly assaulted while holding a peaceful protest outside the Bucharest headquarters of the country’s far-right AUR party.A participant waves the rainbow flag during the gay pride march in Bucharest, Romania (Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)In 2018, Romania held a referendum — backed by the Orthodox Church — on whether to narrow the constitutional definition of marriage from a ″union of spouses″ to a ″union between one man and one woman.”Rights campaigners urged Romanians to boycott the vote, which failed due to low turnout.In neighboring Moldova, which isn’t an EU member but has official candidate status, neither same-sex marriages nor unions are allowed. Large majorities in both countries are Orthodox.BulgariaPublic opinion in Bulgaria is mostly hostile to gay people and more so to same-sex marriages. In the Balkan country, patriarchal family traditions still predominate.The European Court of Human Rights last year found that Bulgaria’s government was violating European human rights law in failing to legally recognize same-sex couples. The court also ruled that Bulgaria is obliged to adopt legal recognition for same-sex couples, but Bulgaria shows no signs of implementing the decision.Leaders of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, which includes about 80% of Bulgarians, condemned the ECHR ruling and called on the government not to give in.Bulgaria’s constitution explicitly prohibits the recognition of same-sex marriage. Amending the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in parliament on three consecutive votes. Such a scenario seems remote.More aboutGreeceEuropean UnionRussiaLGBTQ+SerbiaMontenegroPew Research CenterKyriakos MitsotakisMoldovaVladimir PutinCyprusOrthodoxyChurchesEuropean Court of Human RightsEastern Europe1/7Greece legalises same-sex marriage – will other countries follow?Greece legalises same-sex marriage – will other countries follow?FILE - A protester raises a banner during a rally against same-sex marriage, at central Syntagma square, in Athens Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) Read More By HANNAH SCHOENBAUM Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah Gov. Spencer Cox on Thursday signed legislation censuring a conservative member of the state Board of Education whose social media post questioning the gender of a high school basketball player triggered threats against the girl and led state officials to call for the board member’s resignation.Both legislative chambers had swiftly passed a resolution condemning the actions of Natalie Cline a day after the Utah State Board of Education stripped Cline of her committee assignments and nearly all administrative responsibilities. The board will no longer allow Cline to attend meetings or place items on the agenda, and her colleagues have asked her to resign by Feb. 19.The legislative reprimand carries no real punishment but is a formal way for state leaders to express their disapproval. The measure calling Cline’s actions a “repugnant attack on a student” received unanimous support in the Senate after passing the House earlier Thursday with only two votes against, one from a Democrat and the other from a Republican. Both the Legislature and Board of Education have left it up to Cline whether to resign or remain in her role with limited authority. She is up for reelection in November. Democrats had urged the Republican legislative leaders to punish Cline more harshly, either by impeaching her or by allowing the board to impeach her — a power it does not currently have. READ MORE No. 8 Arizona outlasts Utah 105-99 in triple overtime Utah governor says school board member who questioned a student’s gender ‘embarrassed the state’ In rural Utah, concern over efforts to use Colorado River water to extract lithium Cline, who had previously come under investigation for inflammatory comments about LGBTQ+ students, had singled out the Salt Lake City athlete in a Facebook post that falsely insinuated the girl was transgender. After she learned that the girl was not trans, Cline apologized for provoking a firestorm of vulgar comments. Even then, Cline defended her initial suspicions, saying that a national push to normalize transgender identities makes it “normal to pause and wonder if people are what they say they are.” Cox, a Republican, pushed back Thursday against criticisms from LGBTQ+ rights advocates who argue he and Republican lawmakers enabled Cline’s behavior by enacting a transgender bathroom ban that they say gives people license to question someone’s gender.“Even if this young person was transgender, it would still have been inappropriate,” Cox said. “That is not who we are or what we should be doing.”House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Hooper Republican, said ahead of the vote that members of his chamber were “scattered” on whether to impeach Cline or allow voters to decide her future in the fall. “If this body moves ahead with impeachment, this blows up like a mushroom cloud on the national stage,” Schultz said. “The hate that you’re seeing directed toward that family right now then becomes national. That’s a hard decision to make.”House Minority Leader Angela Romero said she was frustrated that Republican leaders cut off debate before she could propose an amendment that would instead initiate impeachment proceedings. She and her fellow Democrats nonetheless overwhelmingly voted in favor of the resolution to censure Cline. Cox said he thinks the education board’s forceful censure will effectively have the same impact as impeachment. He said he agrees with the actions of both the board and the Legislature and hopes voters will “hold her equally accountable this fall.”In a Facebook post Wednesday, Cline argued the board was taking away her right to represent her constituents without due process. She wrote that she did not have enough time to read all the materials and formulate a response before Wednesday’s meeting.The board determined that Cline had violated policies requiring members to respect student privacy and to uphold state educator standards, which include not participating in sexual or emotional harassment of students and treating students with dignity and respect. The board’s resolution said Cline allowed negative comments about the girl to remain on her social media page while comments in support of the student were deleted, which together “appeared to constitute cyberbullying as defined” in Utah law.In a letter published Thursday in The Salt Lake Tribune, the girl’s parents, Al and Rachel van der Beek, also urged Cline to resign and called for her impeachment.“Ms. Cline did the very thing we teach our children not to do — she blasted social media without fact checking, which ultimately led to a barrage of hateful and despicable comments that were directed at our daughter that lasted for more than 16 hours,” the letter said. “It was one of the most painful things we’ve had to endure.” HANNAH SCHOENBAUM Schoenbaum is a government and politics reporter based in Salt Lake City, Utah.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) (Rick Bowmer, Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved)SALT LAKE CITY – Utah Gov. Spencer Cox on Thursday signed legislation censuring a conservative member of the state Board of Education whose social media post questioning the gender of a high school basketball player triggered threats against the girl and led state officials to call for the board member’s resignation.Both legislative chambers had swiftly passed a resolution condemning the actions of Natalie Cline a day after the Utah State Board of Education stripped Cline of her committee assignments and nearly all administrative responsibilities. The board will no longer allow Cline to attend meetings or place items on the agenda, and her colleagues have asked her to resign by Feb. 19.The legislative reprimand carries no real punishment but is a formal way for state leaders to express their disapproval. The measure calling Cline's actions a “repugnant attack on a student” received unanimous support in the Senate after passing the House earlier Thursday with only two votes against, one from a Democrat and the other from a Republican.Both the Legislature and Board of Education have left it up to Cline whether to resign or remain in her role with limited authority. She is up for reelection in November. Democrats had urged the Republican legislative leaders to punish Cline more harshly, either by impeaching her or by allowing the board to impeach her — a power it does not currently have.Cline, who had previously come under investigation for inflammatory comments about LGBTQ+ students, had singled out the Salt Lake City athlete in a Facebook post that falsely insinuated the girl was transgender. After she learned that the girl was not trans, Cline apologized for provoking a firestorm of vulgar comments. Even then, Cline defended her initial suspicions, saying that a national push to normalize transgender identities makes it “normal to pause and wonder if people are what they say they are.”Cox, a Republican, pushed back Thursday against criticisms from LGBTQ+ rights advocates who argue he and Republican lawmakers enabled Cline’s behavior by enacting a transgender bathroom ban that they say gives people license to question someone’s gender.“Even if this young person was transgender, it would still have been inappropriate,” Cox said. “That is not who we are or what we should be doing.”House Speaker Mike Schultz, a Hooper Republican, said ahead of the vote that members of his chamber were “scattered” on whether to impeach Cline or allow voters to decide her future in the fall. “If this body moves ahead with impeachment, this blows up like a mushroom cloud on the national stage,"" Schultz said. “The hate that you’re seeing directed toward that family right now then becomes national. That’s a hard decision to make.”House Minority Leader Angela Romero said she was frustrated that Republican leaders cut off debate before she could propose an amendment that would instead initiate impeachment proceedings. She and her fellow Democrats nonetheless overwhelmingly voted in favor of the resolution to censure Cline. Cox said he thinks the education board's forceful censure will effectively have the same impact as impeachment. He said he agrees with the actions of both the board and the Legislature and hopes voters will ""hold her equally accountable this fall.”In a Facebook post Wednesday, Cline argued the board was taking away her right to represent her constituents without due process. She wrote that she did not have enough time to read all the materials and formulate a response before Wednesday’s meeting.The board determined that Cline had violated policies requiring members to respect student privacy and to uphold state educator standards, which include not participating in sexual or emotional harassment of students and treating students with dignity and respect.The board's resolution said Cline allowed negative comments about the girl to remain on her social media page while comments in support of the student were deleted, which together “appeared to constitute cyberbullying as defined” in Utah law.In a letter published Thursday in The Salt Lake Tribune, the girl’s parents, Al and Rachel van der Beek, also urged Cline to resign and called for her impeachment.“Ms. Cline did the very thing we teach our children not to do — she blasted social media without fact checking, which ultimately led to a barrage of hateful and despicable comments that were directed at our daughter that lasted for more than 16 hours,” the letter said. “It was one of the most painful things we’ve had to endure.”Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Will other Orthodox countries join them any time soon? Greece has become the first Orthodox Christian nation to legalize same-sex civil marriage. (Feb 15). Photos 7 By PETER SMITH and DASHA LITVINOVA Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print Greece has become the first majority-Orthodox Christian nation to legalize same-sex marriage under civil law. At least for the near future, it will almost certainly be the only one.Eastern Orthodox leadership, despite lacking a single doctrinal authority like a pope, has been united in opposing recognition of same-sex relationships both within its own rites and in the civil realm. Public opinion in majority Orthodox countries has mostly been opposed, too.But there are some signs of change. Two small majority-Orthodox countries, Montenegro and Cyprus, have authorized same-sex unions in recent years, as did Greece in 2015 before upgrading to this week’s approval of full marital status. Civil unions may become more common among Orthodox countries gravitating toward the European Union. They remain off the table in Russia, which has cracked down on LGBTQ+ expression, and countries in its orbit. Following is a summary of church positions and public opinion in the Orthodox world, followed by the situation in individual majority-Orthodox lands. THE ORTHODOX WORLDEastern Orthodoxy is a socially conservative, ancient church with elaborate rituals and a strict hierarchy. Churches are mostly organized along national lines, with multiple independent churches that share ancient doctrine and practices and that both cooperate and squabble.Roughly 200 million Eastern Orthodox live primarily in Eastern Europe and neighboring Asian lands, with about half that total in Russia, while smaller numbers live across the world. Like other international church bodies, Orthodoxy has confronted calls for LGBTQ+ inclusion. A 2016 statement by a council of most Orthodox churches called marriage between a man and a woman “the oldest institution of divine law” and said members were forbidden from entering same-sex unions.Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, considered the first among equals among Orthodox leaders, affirmed that stance in a statement after the Greek vote. But he added that the church must respond to members in such unions “with pastoral responsibility and in Christ-like love.”In countries where they are a majority, Orthodox believers overwhelmingly said society should not accept homosexuality or approve same-sex marriage, according to surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 by the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank.Greek Orthodox showed relative tolerance, with half of Orthodox saying homosexuality should be accepted and a quarter favoring same-sex marriage. In more recent polls, Greeks overall narrowly supported the marriage law.The Greek law validates marriage in the civil realm but doesn’t require any church to perform such rites. Nevertheless, Greece’s Orthodox leadership unanimously opposed the law in January, saying the “duality of genders and their complementarity are not social inventions but originate from God.”Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged the church’s position but said, “We are discussing the decisions of the Greek state, unrelated to theological beliefs.”Civil unions may be in some Orthodox countries’ near future, said George Demacopoulos, director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University in New York. “In terms of civil marriage, I think the countries that are in the European Union will eventually all do it,” Demacopoulos said. “My guess is the assemblies of bishops in those countries will offer some resistance to the measure, and depending on where you are, that may or may not delay it.” UKRAINEIn Ukraine, same-sex couples cannot register their status legally.In 2023, the issue became acute as many LGBTQ+ people joined Ukraine’s armed forces. That year, a bill was introduced in Parliament to establish civil partnerships for same-sex couples, providing basic rights such as compensation if one of the partners is killed in action.The All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations — which includes Ukraine’s two rival Orthodox churches — opposed the draft law, contending that some international entities are using the country’s current vulnerability to force unwanted changes.The legislation remains pending.The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2023 that Ukraine violated the rights of a same-sex couple who sought legal protections provided to married heterosexual couples. Ukraine is majority Orthodox, with various religious minorities.RUSSIAIn increasingly conservative Russia, President Vladimir Putin has forged a powerful alliance with the Russian Orthodox Church and has made “traditional family values” a cornerstone of his rule, juxtaposing them with “perversions” of the West.Putin effectively outlawed same-sex marriages in the 2020 constitutional revision that added a clause stipulating that marriage is a union of a man and a woman.In 2013, the Kremlin adopted what’s known as the “gay propaganda” law, banning any public endorsement of “nontraditional sexual relations” among minors.After sending troops into Ukraine in 2022, Russian authorities ramped up a campaign against what it called the West’s “degrading” moral influence, in what rights advocates saw as an attempt to legitimize the war.Patriarch Kirill of Moscow has assailed LGBTQ+ rights. As head of the Russian Orthodox Church, he oversees the world’s largest Orthodox flock. He depicted his country’s invasion of Ukraine as part of a metaphysical struggle against a liberal agenda that included “gay parades.”In November, Russia’s Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism, labeling what the government called the LGBTQ+ “international movement” as an extremist group and banning it in Russia. In 2021, a survey by Russia’s top independent pollster, the Levada Center, showed that only 33% of Russians completely or somewhat agree that gay men and women should enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals, a decrease from earlier years.BELARUSThe Belarus Family Code defines marriage as a “union between a man and a woman.” There is also no legislation prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.Homosexuality was decriminalized in Belarus in 1994, but the LGBTQ+ community faces heavy stigma and high suicide rates, advocates say.Human rights groups report hundreds of cases of the KGB — the country’s main domestic security agency — trying to recruit gay people and threatening to out them.SERBIA AND MONTENEGROSerbia and Montenegro, two conservative Balkan nations where the Serbian Orthodox Church holds huge influence, have had mixed results addressing LGBTQ+ rights as part of efforts to join the European Union.Tiny Montenegro passed a bill in 2020 allowing same-sex partnerships — not marriage and with fewer rights. In Serbia, a similar draft law never made it to a parliamentary vote.The Serbian Orthodox Church, which maintains close relations with the Russian church, has opposed the idea of same-sex marriages.Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic has said he would not sign off a bill on same-sex marriages, although Serbia has had an openly lesbian prime minister for years. Activists have been campaigning for legal partnerships.Pride marches in Serbia are routinely banned or held under tight security. In Montenegro, though same-sex partnerships are allowed, the highly male-oriented society of 620,000 people remains divided over the issue.ROMANIA AND MOLDOVARomania is one of the few European Union members that allows neither same-sex marriage nor civil unions, despite a growing social acceptance of LGBTQ+ people.In 2023, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Romania had failed to enforce same-sex couples’ rights by not legally recognizing their relationships. In early February in Romania, LGBTQ+ activists were allegedly assaulted while holding a peaceful protest outside the Bucharest headquarters of the country’s far-right AUR party.In 2018, Romania held a referendum — backed by the Orthodox Church — on whether to narrow the constitutional definition of marriage from a ″union of spouses″ to a ″union between one man and one woman.”Rights campaigners urged Romanians to boycott the vote, which failed due to low turnout.In neighboring Moldova, which isn’t an EU member but has official candidate status, neither same-sex marriages nor unions are allowed. Large majorities in both countries are Orthodox.BULGARIAPublic opinion in Bulgaria is mostly hostile to gay people and more so to same-sex marriages. In the Balkan country, patriarchal family traditions still predominate.The European Court of Human Rights last year found that Bulgaria’s government was violating European human rights law in failing to legally recognize same-sex couples. The court also ruled that Bulgaria is obliged to adopt legal recognition for same-sex couples, but Bulgaria shows no signs of implementing the decision.Leaders of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, which includes about 80% of Bulgarians, condemned the ECHR ruling and called on the government not to give in.Bulgaria’s constitution explicitly prohibits the recognition of same-sex marriage. Amending the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in parliament on three consecutive votes. Such a scenario seems remote.___Smith reported from Pittsburgh and Litvinova from Tallinn, Estonia.

Log in here » Greece has become the first majority-Orthodox Christian nation to legalize same-sex marriage under civil law. At least for the near future, it will almost certainly be the only one. Eastern Orthodox leadership, despite lacking a single doctrinal authority like a pope, has been united in opposing recognition of same-sex relationships both within its own rites and in the civil realm. Public opinion in majority Orthodox countries has mostly been opposed, too. But there are some signs of change. Two small majority-Orthodox countries, Montenegro and Cyprus, have authorized same-sex unions in recent years, as did Greece in 2015 before upgrading to this week’s approval of full marital status. FILE - A gay rights activist stands with a rainbow flag, in front of journalists, during a protesting picket at Dvortsovaya (Palace) Square in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Aug. 2, 2015. Greece is becoming the first majority-Orthodox Christian nation to legalize same-sex marriage. At least for the near future, it will be the only one. The Eastern Orthodox leadership, despite lacking a single doctrinal authority like a pope, has been unanimous in opposing recognition of same-sex relationships. (AP Photo, File) Civil unions may become more common among Orthodox countries gravitating toward the European Union. They remain off the table in Russia, which has cracked down on LGBTQ+ expression, and countries in its orbit. Following is a summary of church positions and public opinion in the Orthodox world, followed by the situation in individual majority-Orthodox lands. THE ORTHODOX WORLD Eastern Orthodoxy is a socially conservative, ancient church with elaborate rituals and a strict hierarchy. Churches are mostly organized along national lines, with multiple independent churches that share ancient doctrine and practices and that both cooperate and squabble. Roughly 200 million Eastern Orthodox live primarily in Eastern Europe and neighboring Asian lands, with about half that total in Russia, while smaller numbers live across the world. Like other international church bodies, Orthodoxy has confronted calls for LGBTQ+ inclusion. A 2016 statement by a council of most Orthodox churches called marriage between a man and a woman “the oldest institution of divine law” and said members were forbidden from entering same-sex unions. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, considered the first among equals among Orthodox leaders, affirmed that stance in a statement after the Greek vote. But he added that the church must respond to members in such unions “with pastoral responsibility and in Christ-like love.” In countries where they are a majority, Orthodox believers overwhelmingly said society should not accept homosexuality or approve same-sex marriage, according to surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 by the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank. Greek Orthodox showed relative tolerance, with half of Orthodox saying homosexuality should be accepted and a quarter favoring same-sex marriage. In more recent polls, Greeks overall narrowly supported the marriage law. The Greek law validates marriage in the civil realm but doesn’t require any church to perform such rites. Nevertheless, Greece’s Orthodox leadership unanimously opposed the law in January, saying the “duality of genders and their complementarity are not social inventions but originate from God.” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged the church’s position but said, “We are discussing the decisions of the Greek state, unrelated to theological beliefs.” Civil unions may be in some Orthodox countries’ near future, said George Demacopoulos, director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University in New York. “In terms of civil marriage, I think the countries that are in the European Union will eventually all do it,” Demacopoulos said. “My guess is the assemblies of bishops in those countries will offer some resistance to the measure, and depending on where you are, that may or may not delay it.” UKRAINE In Ukraine, same-sex couples cannot register their status legally. In 2023, the issue became acute as many LGBTQ+ people joined Ukraine’s armed forces. That year, a bill was introduced in Parliament to establish civil partnerships for same-sex couples, providing basic rights such as compensation if one of the partners is killed in action. The All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations — which includes Ukraine’s two rival Orthodox churches — opposed the draft law, contending that some international entities are using the country’s current vulnerability to force unwanted changes. The legislation remains pending. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2023 that Ukraine violated the rights of a same-sex couple who sought legal protections provided to married heterosexual couples. Ukraine is majority Orthodox, with various religious minorities. RUSSIA In increasingly conservative Russia, President Vladimir Putin has forged a powerful alliance with the Russian Orthodox Church and has made “traditional family values” a cornerstone of his rule, juxtaposing them with “perversions” of the West. Putin effectively outlawed same-sex marriages in the 2020 constitutional revision that added a clause stipulating that marriage is a union of a man and a woman. In 2013, the Kremlin adopted what’s known as the “gay propaganda” law, banning any public endorsement of “nontraditional sexual relations” among minors. After sending troops into Ukraine in 2022, Russian authorities ramped up a campaign against what it called the West’s “degrading” moral influence, in what rights advocates saw as an attempt to legitimize the war. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow has assailed LGBTQ+ rights. As head of the Russian Orthodox Church, he oversees the world’s largest Orthodox flock. He depicted his country’s invasion of Ukraine as part of a metaphysical struggle against a liberal agenda that included “gay parades.” In November, Russia’s Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism, labeling what the government called the LGBTQ+ “international movement” as an extremist group and banning it in Russia. In 2021, a survey by Russia’s top independent pollster, the Levada Center, showed that only 33% of Russians completely or somewhat agree that gay men and women should enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals, a decrease from earlier years.

(AP Photo/Risto Bozovic, File) Greece has become the first majority-Orthodox Christian nation to legalize same-sex marriage under civil law. At least for the near future, it will almost certainly be the only one. Eastern Orthodox leadership, despite lacking a single doctrinal authority like a pope, has been united in opposing recognition of same-sex relationships both within its own rites and in the civil realm. Public opinion in majority Orthodox countries has mostly been opposed, too. But there are some signs of change. Two small majority-Orthodox countries, Montenegro and Cyprus, have authorized same-sex unions in recent years, as did Greece in 2015 before upgrading to this week’s approval of full marital status. Civil unions may become more common among Orthodox countries gravitating toward the European Union. They remain off the table in Russia, which has cracked down on LGBTQ+ expression, and countries in its orbit. Following is a summary of church positions and public opinion in the Orthodox world, followed by the situation in individual majority-Orthodox lands. THE ORTHODOX WORLD Eastern Orthodoxy is a socially conservative, ancient church with elaborate rituals and a strict hierarchy. Churches are mostly organized along national lines, with multiple independent churches that share ancient doctrine and practices and that both cooperate and squabble. Roughly 200 million Eastern Orthodox live primarily in Eastern Europe and neighboring Asian lands, with about half that total in Russia, while smaller numbers live across the world. Like other international church bodies, Orthodoxy has confronted calls for LGBTQ+ inclusion. A 2016 statement by a council of most Orthodox churches called marriage between a man and a woman “the oldest institution of divine law” and said members were forbidden from entering same-sex unions. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, considered the first among equals among Orthodox leaders, affirmed that stance in a statement after the Greek vote. But he added that the church must respond to members in such unions “with pastoral responsibility and in Christ-like love.” In countries where they are a majority, Orthodox believers overwhelmingly said society should not accept homosexuality or approve same-sex marriage, according to surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 by the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank. Greek Orthodox showed relative tolerance, with half of Orthodox saying homosexuality should be accepted and a quarter favoring same-sex marriage. In more recent polls, Greeks overall narrowly supported the marriage law. The Greek law validates marriage in the civil realm but doesn't require any church to perform such rites. Nevertheless, Greece’s Orthodox leadership unanimously opposed the law in January, saying the “duality of genders and their complementarity are not social inventions but originate from God.” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged the church’s position but said, “We are discussing the decisions of the Greek state, unrelated to theological beliefs.” Civil unions may be in some Orthodox countries’ near future, said George Demacopoulos, director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University in New York. “In terms of civil marriage, I think the countries that are in the European Union will eventually all do it,” Demacopoulos said. “My guess is the assemblies of bishops in those countries will offer some resistance to the measure, and depending on where you are, that may or may not delay it.” UKRAINE In Ukraine, same-sex couples cannot register their status legally. In 2023, the issue became acute as many LGBTQ+ people joined Ukraine’s armed forces. That year, a bill was introduced in Parliament to establish civil partnerships for same-sex couples, providing basic rights such as compensation if one of the partners is killed in action. The All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations — which includes Ukraine’s two rival Orthodox churches — opposed the draft law, contending that some international entities are using the country’s current vulnerability to force unwanted changes. The legislation remains pending. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2023 that Ukraine violated the rights of a same-sex couple who sought legal protections provided to married heterosexual couples. Ukraine is majority Orthodox, with various religious minorities. RUSSIA In increasingly conservative Russia, President Vladimir Putin has forged a powerful alliance with the Russian Orthodox Church and has made “traditional family values” a cornerstone of his rule, juxtaposing them with “perversions” of the West. Putin effectively outlawed same-sex marriages in the 2020 constitutional revision that added a clause stipulating that marriage is a union of a man and a woman. In 2013, the Kremlin adopted what’s known as the “gay propaganda” law, banning any public endorsement of “nontraditional sexual relations” among minors. After sending troops into Ukraine in 2022, Russian authorities ramped up a campaign against what it called the West’s “degrading” moral influence, in what rights advocates saw as an attempt to legitimize the war. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow has assailed LGBTQ+ rights. As head of the Russian Orthodox Church, he oversees the world's largest Orthodox flock. He depicted his country’s invasion of Ukraine as part of a metaphysical struggle against a liberal agenda that included “gay parades.” In November, Russia’s Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ+ activism, labeling what the government called the LGBTQ+ “international movement” as an extremist group and banning it in Russia. In 2021, a survey by Russia’s top independent pollster, the Levada Center, showed that only 33% of Russians completely or somewhat agree that gay men and women should enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals, a decrease from earlier years. BELARUS The Belarus Family Code defines marriage as a “union between a man and a woman.” There is also no legislation prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Homosexuality was decriminalized in Belarus in 1994, but the LGBTQ+ community faces heavy stigma and high suicide rates, advocates say. Human rights groups report hundreds of cases of the KGB — the country’s main domestic security agency — trying to recruit gay people and threatening to out them. SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO Serbia and Montenegro, two conservative Balkan nations where the Serbian Orthodox Church holds huge influence, have had mixed results addressing LGBTQ+ rights as part of efforts to join the European Union. Tiny Montenegro passed a bill in 2020 allowing same-sex partnerships — not marriage and with fewer rights. In Serbia, a similar draft law never made it to a parliamentary vote. The Serbian Orthodox Church, which maintains close relations with the Russian church, has opposed the idea of same-sex marriages. Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic has said he would not sign off a bill on same-sex marriages, although Serbia has had an openly lesbian prime minister for years. Activists have been campaigning for legal partnerships. Pride marches in Serbia are routinely banned or held under tight security. In Montenegro, though same-sex partnerships are allowed, the highly male-oriented society of 620,000 people remains divided over the issue. ROMANIA AND MOLDOVA Romania is one of the few European Union members that allows neither same-sex marriage nor civil unions, despite a growing social acceptance of LGBTQ+ people. In 2023, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Romania had failed to enforce same-sex couples’ rights by not legally recognizing their relationships. In early February in Romania, LGBTQ+ activists were allegedly assaulted while holding a peaceful protest outside the Bucharest headquarters of the country’s far-right AUR party. In 2018, Romania held a referendum — backed by the Orthodox Church — on whether to narrow the constitutional definition of marriage from a ″union of spouses″ to a ″union between one man and one woman.” Rights campaigners urged Romanians to boycott the vote, which failed due to low turnout. In neighboring Moldova, which isn’t an EU member but has official candidate status, neither same-sex marriages nor unions are allowed. Large majorities in both countries are Orthodox. BULGARIA Public opinion in Bulgaria is mostly hostile to gay people and more so to same-sex marriages. In the Balkan country, patriarchal family traditions still predominate. The European Court of Human Rights last year found that Bulgaria’s government was violating European human rights law in failing to legally recognize same-sex couples. The court also ruled that Bulgaria is obliged to adopt legal recognition for same-sex couples, but Bulgaria shows no signs of implementing the decision. Leaders of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, which includes about 80% of Bulgarians, condemned the ECHR ruling and called on the government not to give in. Bulgaria’s constitution explicitly prohibits the recognition of same-sex marriage. Amending the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in parliament on three consecutive votes.

So, you’re very close to the rectum and it’s very hard–it’s very easy to get in there. We don’t, I mean, the more you do it, the less risk you have, of course.” WPATH is a medical organization that has published an influential clinical guidance on transgender health care called Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People (SOC). Laungani’s presentation, entitled “Foundations in Surgery,” was part of an educational series recorded in September 2022 for licensed clinicians seeking WPATH certification in transgender health care. Laungani is a WPATH member, The WPATH Standards of Care recommend that transgender surgeons be educated, trained and supervised on how to perform sex reassignment surgeries. However, Laungani said in his presentation that as the number of sex-reassignment programs had grown, it was likely some surgeons had not received adequate training. “We’ve seen a growing number of programs throughout the world of gender affirmation, probably with a lack of training and not proper training, for now,” said Laungani. “And so, you know, better ca–any care was better, probably, than no care. So, it did allow individuals to have access to surgery. But it’s time just to make sure that we have the right training and that everybody has the same standard because the patients deserve it. “And, so, we need to make sure that, you know, we’ll build these training programs, fellowships, and things,” he said. “And it’s really happening now. So, this is going to be something mandatory.” “Well, you do great only what you do often, right,” Laungani said. “So, if you do a vaginoplasty every two years, I don’t think you could consider yourself proficient. You’re going to have more complications. “You’re not going to follow up, you know, and you’re not going to be that interested that you actually go and hang out at these kinds of conferences and learn from your colleagues, because you’re not going to do it as much,” he said. “So, I think you need to dedicate a huge part of your practice to gender-affirming care if you are going to do it at all.” WATCH: In this WPATH presentation, Laungani gave an overview of vaginoplasty, a surgery that seeks to create a vagina by removing male genitalia, surgically creating a vaginal canal, and lining the canal with tissue which often comes from other parts of the body. Laungani discussed the details of a vaginoplasty procedure, saying: “So, you’ll use the skin of the penis to tack it down and invert it and start the beginning of lining of the canal. But you won’t have enough skin to line the entire canal–to some, there are some rare exceptions–so you’ll need some extra tissue there.” Laungani said this tissue needed for the vaginal canal can be taken from the abdomen, scrotum, or colon. However, he warned that using colon tissue could increase the risk of complications. “Or you could be using even a piece of colon,” he said. “So, to use colon vaginoplasty, um, usually that’s reserved for secondary deepening. We don’t do it as a primary intervention because it’s more morbid. You get to, you know, you have to cut bowel, you know it’s more, you may have, encounter, more complications,” said Laungani. One article published in 2023 in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery stated: “Penile inversion vaginoplasty (PIV) is a common procedure for transfeminine patients, with the goal of creating a functional vaginal canal and clitoris and a natural-appearing vulva. Creation of the neovagina requires opening the prerectal space, most commonly from a perineal approach, and the reported rates of rectal perforation during this dissection range from 3% to 5%.” A slide in the WPATH presentation listed possible complications of vaginoplasty, which include minor wound dehiscence, vaginal stenosis, recto-vaginal fistula, pelvic floor dysfunction, and clitoris necrosis. During the presentation, Laungani noted the rate of wound dehiscence, a complication in which a surgical incision reopens, could be as high as 75%. “I think for the dehiscence you can expect as much as probably 75 percent,” he said. In the recording, Laungani explained that within the first week after surgery, a vaginoplasty patient must begin regularly dilating the surgically created vagina, sometimes called a neovagina, to prevent closure. He described dilation as a sometimes painful, time-consuming process, saying patients have to dilate themselves up to four times a day. Screenshot from the WPATH Presentation Showing Dilation Schedule Following Vaginoplasty Surgery “[A]s soon as we remove that vaginal stent, we start dilating because there will be a tendency from the body to want to contract and close that, considered as a wound sort of. So, you’ll have to fight that contraction and then dilate quite a bit at first. Which is, you know, what the patients call a full-time job for the first few months because it’s four times a day. It’s a lot,” said Laungani. During a question-and-answer segment, Laungani was asked if there were any non-surgical interventions to redialate a neovagina that had not been dilated for approximately two years. “That scar tissue is really rock hard. It’s like concrete. You can’t, once it’s settled, you won’t’ be able to just go, even with tiny dilators, and then increase the size of the dilators. It’s just not going to work. So, it has to be surgical,” responded Laungani. Laungani was also asked about sexual function after vaginoplasty. “Can they orgasm still?” a person asked him. “I wish we had more data on that,” Laungani said. “But the answer is: Yes, they can. For some individuals definitely do relate that–either by self-palpitation or through penetration or other sexual activities that they have around the clitoris.” “The only thing we know is that there’s going to be more tendency to be able to orgasm if you were to, if you were able to orgasm before surgery. So, but you know, some, the patients who were not masturbating before surgery, then you would have potentially more issues to reach that orgasm after surgery,” Laungani said. The Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported that Dr. Daniel Metzger, a WPATH certified pediatric endocrinologist, warned that if puberty blockers are started too early, boys may not develop the genital tissue needed to create a surgical vagina later in life. “When you think about vaginoplasty, the creation of a vagina in an assigned male, you need tissue, genital tissue, to create that vagina,” said Metzger. “And if we are taking an 11-year-old boy, who does not have a lot of genital tissue and blocking puberty right there, we’re preventing the growth of the vagina for down the road.” WPATH and Dr. Alex Laungani did not respond to a request for comment.

So, you’re very close to the rectum and it’s very hard–it’s very easy to get in there. We don’t, I mean, the more you do it, the less risk you have, of course.” WPATH is a medical organization that has published an influential clinical guidance on transgender health care called Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People (SOC). Laungani’s presentation, entitled “Foundations in Surgery,” was part of an educational series recorded in September 2022 for licensed clinicians seeking WPATH certification in transgender health care. Laungani is a WPATH member, The WPATH Standards of Care recommend that transgender surgeons be educated, trained and supervised on how to perform sex reassignment surgeries. However, Laungani (pictured above) said in his presentation that as the number of sex-reassignment programs had grown, it was likely some surgeons had not received adequate training. “We’ve seen a growing number of programs throughout the world of gender affirmation, probably with a lack of training and not proper training, for now,” said Laungani. “And so, you know, better ca–any care was better, probably, than no care. So, it did allow individuals to have access to surgery. But it’s time just to make sure that we have the right training and that everybody has the same standard because the patients deserve it. “And, so, we need to make sure that, you know, we’ll build these training programs, fellowships, and things,” he said. “And it’s really happening now. So, this is going to be something mandatory.” “Well, you do great only what you do often, right,” Laungani said. “So, if you do a vaginoplasty every two years, I don’t think you could consider yourself proficient. You’re going to have more complications. “You’re not going to follow up, you know, and you’re not going to be that interested that you actually go and hang out at these kinds of conferences and learn from your colleagues, because you’re not going to do it as much,” he said. “So, I think you need to dedicate a huge part of your practice to gender-affirming care if you are going to do it at all.” Screenshot from the WPATH Presentation Showing Dilation Schedule Following Vaginoplasty Surgery In this WPATH presentation, Laungani gave an overview of vaginoplasty, a surgery that seeks to create a vagina by removing male genitalia, surgically creating a vaginal canal, and lining the canal with tissue which often comes from other parts of the body. Laungani discussed the details of a vaginoplasty procedure, saying: “So, you’ll use the skin of the penis to tack it down and invert it and start the beginning of lining of the canal. But you won’t have enough skin to line the entire canal–to some, there are some rare exceptions–so you’ll need some extra tissue there.” Laungani said this tissue needed for the vaginal canal can be taken from the abdomen, scrotum, or colon. However, he warned that using colon tissue could increase the risk of complications. “Or you could be using even a piece of colon,” he said. “So, to use colon vaginoplasty, um, usually that’s reserved for secondary deepening. We don’t do it as a primary intervention because it’s more morbid. You get to, you know, you have to cut bowel, you know it’s more, you may have, encounter, more complications,” said Laungani. One article published in 2023 in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery stated: “Penile inversion vaginoplasty (PIV) is a common procedure for transfeminine patients, with the goal of creating a functional vaginal canal and clitoris and a natural-appearing vulva. Creation of the neovagina requires opening the prerectal space, most commonly from a perineal approach, and the reported rates of rectal perforation during this dissection range from 3% to 5%.” A slide in the WPATH presentation listed possible complications of vaginoplasty, which include minor wound dehiscence, vaginal stenosis, recto-vaginal fistula, pelvic floor dysfunction, and clitoris necrosis. During the presentation, Laungani noted the rate of wound dehiscence, a complication in which a surgical incision reopens, could be as high as 75%. “I think for the dehiscence you can expect as much as probably 75 percent,” he said. In the recording, Laungani explained that within the first week after surgery, a vaginoplasty patient must begin regularly dilating the surgically created vagina, sometimes called a neovagina, to prevent closure. He described dilation as a sometimes painful, time-consuming process, saying patients have to dilate themselves up to four times a day. “[A]s soon as we remove that vaginal stent, we start dilating because there will be a tendency from the body to want to contract and close that, considered as a wound sort of. So, you’ll have to fight that contraction and then dilate quite a bit at first. Which is, you know, what the patients call a full-time job for the first few months because it’s four times a day. It’s a lot,” said Laungani. During a question-and-answer segment, Laungani was asked if there were any non-surgical interventions to redialate a neovagina that had not been dilated for approximately two years. “That scar tissue is really rock hard. It’s like concrete. You can’t, once it’s settled, you won’t’ be able to just go, even with tiny dilators, and then increase the size of the dilators. It’s just not going to work. So, it has to be surgical,” responded Laungani. Laungani was also asked about sexual function after vaginoplasty. “Can they orgasm still?” a person asked him. “I wish we had more data on that,” Laungani said. “But the answer is: Yes, they can. For some individuals definitely do relate that–either by self-palpitation or through penetration or other sexual activities that they have around the clitoris.” “The only thing we know is that there’s going to be more tendency to be able to orgasm if you were to, if you were able to orgasm before surgery. So, but you know, some, the patients who were not masturbating before surgery, then you would have potentially more issues to reach that orgasm after surgery,” Laungani said. The Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported that Dr. Daniel Metzger, a WPATH certified pediatric endocrinologist, warned that if puberty blockers are started too early, boys may not develop the genital tissue needed to create a surgical vagina later in life. “When you think about vaginoplasty, the creation of a vagina in an assigned male, you need tissue, genital tissue, to create that vagina,” said Metzger. “And if we are taking an 11-year-old boy, who does not have a lot of genital tissue and blocking puberty right there, we’re preventing the growth of the vagina for down the road.” WPATH and Dr. Alex Laungani did not respond to a request for comment. – – – Megan Brock is a reporter at Daily Caller News Foundation.

So, you’re very close to the rectum and it’s very hard–it’s very easy to get in there. We don’t, I mean, the more you do it, the less risk you have, of course.” WPATH is a medical organization that has published an influential clinical guidance on transgender health care called Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People (SOC). Laungani’s presentation, entitled “Foundations in Surgery,” was part of an educational series recorded in September 2022 for licensed clinicians seeking WPATH certification in transgender health care. Laungani is a WPATH member, The WPATH Standards of Care recommend that transgender surgeons be educated, trained and supervised on how to perform sex reassignment surgeries. However, Laungani (pictured above) said in his presentation that as the number of sex-reassignment programs had grown, it was likely some surgeons had not received adequate training. “We’ve seen a growing number of programs throughout the world of gender affirmation, probably with a lack of training and not proper training, for now,” said Laungani. “And so, you know, better ca–any care was better, probably, than no care. So, it did allow individuals to have access to surgery. But it’s time just to make sure that we have the right training and that everybody has the same standard because the patients deserve it. “And, so, we need to make sure that, you know, we’ll build these training programs, fellowships, and things,” he said. “And it’s really happening now. So, this is going to be something mandatory.” “Well, you do great only what you do often, right,” Laungani said. “So, if you do a vaginoplasty every two years, I don’t think you could consider yourself proficient. You’re going to have more complications. “You’re not going to follow up, you know, and you’re not going to be that interested that you actually go and hang out at these kinds of conferences and learn from your colleagues, because you’re not going to do it as much,” he said. “So, I think you need to dedicate a huge part of your practice to gender-affirming care if you are going to do it at all.” Screenshot from the WPATH Presentation Showing Dilation Schedule Following Vaginoplasty Surgery In this WPATH presentation, Laungani gave an overview of vaginoplasty, a surgery that seeks to create a vagina by removing male genitalia, surgically creating a vaginal canal, and lining the canal with tissue which often comes from other parts of the body. Laungani discussed the details of a vaginoplasty procedure, saying: “So, you’ll use the skin of the penis to tack it down and invert it and start the beginning of lining of the canal. But you won’t have enough skin to line the entire canal–to some, there are some rare exceptions–so you’ll need some extra tissue there.” Laungani said this tissue needed for the vaginal canal can be taken from the abdomen, scrotum, or colon. However, he warned that using colon tissue could increase the risk of complications. “Or you could be using even a piece of colon,” he said. “So, to use colon vaginoplasty, um, usually that’s reserved for secondary deepening. We don’t do it as a primary intervention because it’s more morbid. You get to, you know, you have to cut bowel, you know it’s more, you may have, encounter, more complications,” said Laungani. One article published in 2023 in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery stated: “Penile inversion vaginoplasty (PIV) is a common procedure for transfeminine patients, with the goal of creating a functional vaginal canal and clitoris and a natural-appearing vulva. Creation of the neovagina requires opening the prerectal space, most commonly from a perineal approach, and the reported rates of rectal perforation during this dissection range from 3% to 5%.” A slide in the WPATH presentation listed possible complications of vaginoplasty, which include minor wound dehiscence, vaginal stenosis, recto-vaginal fistula, pelvic floor dysfunction, and clitoris necrosis. During the presentation, Laungani noted the rate of wound dehiscence, a complication in which a surgical incision reopens, could be as high as 75%. “I think for the dehiscence you can expect as much as probably 75 percent,” he said. In the recording, Laungani explained that within the first week after surgery, a vaginoplasty patient must begin regularly dilating the surgically created vagina, sometimes called a neovagina, to prevent closure. He described dilation as a sometimes painful, time-consuming process, saying patients have to dilate themselves up to four times a day. “[A]s soon as we remove that vaginal stent, we start dilating because there will be a tendency from the body to want to contract and close that, considered as a wound sort of. So, you’ll have to fight that contraction and then dilate quite a bit at first. Which is, you know, what the patients call a full-time job for the first few months because it’s four times a day. It’s a lot,” said Laungani. During a question-and-answer segment, Laungani was asked if there were any non-surgical interventions to redialate a neovagina that had not been dilated for approximately two years. “That scar tissue is really rock hard. It’s like concrete. You can’t, once it’s settled, you won’t’ be able to just go, even with tiny dilators, and then increase the size of the dilators. It’s just not going to work. So, it has to be surgical,” responded Laungani. Laungani was also asked about sexual function after vaginoplasty. “Can they orgasm still?” a person asked him. “I wish we had more data on that,” Laungani said. “But the answer is: Yes, they can. For some individuals definitely do relate that–either by self-palpitation or through penetration or other sexual activities that they have around the clitoris.” “The only thing we know is that there’s going to be more tendency to be able to orgasm if you were to, if you were able to orgasm before surgery. So, but you know, some, the patients who were not masturbating before surgery, then you would have potentially more issues to reach that orgasm after surgery,” Laungani said. The Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported that Dr. Daniel Metzger, a WPATH certified pediatric endocrinologist, warned that if puberty blockers are started too early, boys may not develop the genital tissue needed to create a surgical vagina later in life. “When you think about vaginoplasty, the creation of a vagina in an assigned male, you need tissue, genital tissue, to create that vagina,” said Metzger. “And if we are taking an 11-year-old boy, who does not have a lot of genital tissue and blocking puberty right there, we’re preventing the growth of the vagina for down the road.” WPATH and Dr. Alex Laungani did not respond to a request for comment. – – – Megan Brock is a reporter at Daily Caller News Foundation.

Jamie Raskin, center, and Jared Huffman are among the Democrats calling for answers about a prayer delivered by a guest chaplain in January. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo) By Nina Heller Posted February 15, 2024 at 5:34pm Lawmakers are asking for answers after a guest chaplain known for his incendiary preaching was sponsored by Speaker Mike Johnson to give the House’s daily opening prayer last month, according to a letter sent to the speaker and the Office of the Chaplain signed by 26 Democratic House members. The letter describes pastor Jack Hibbs as “a radical Christian Nationalist who helped fuel the January 6th insurrection and has a long record of spewing hateful vitriol toward non-Christians, immigrants, and members of the LGBTQ community.” Hibbs should not have been allowed to deliver the opening prayer on Jan. 30, argues the letter, which was led by Reps. Jared Huffman of California, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin. “After we picked our jaws up off the floor upon learning that this hate preacher had been allowed to give a guest invocation, I think many of us decided we need to start calling this out,” Huffman told Roll Call. The letter accuses Johnson of hosting “an ill-qualified hate preacher” who shares his own “Christian nationalist agenda,” and points to guidelines for hosting guest chaplains that he may have ignored. In a video posted to his YouTube channel last year, Hibbs called transgender people part of a “sexually perverted cult.” He is also a supporter of conversion therapy for LGBTQ people and launched a national campaign requiring schools to out transgender students to defeat “demonic and dark satanic powers.” In his invocation delivered in the House chamber on Jan. 30, Hibbs called for “repentance of our national sins,” and used the words “holy fear,” which the letter argues were “allusions to the militant and fanatical agenda he preaches about the LGBTQ community, Jews, Muslims, and anyone who conflicts with his ‘biblical worldview.’” Hibbs has previously called Islam a “death cult” and said Jewish people are under a “God-given blindness.” For Huffman, the guest appearance represents an affront to “pluralism and religious diversity in this country.” “We really do continue to elevate certain types of Christian religion above everyone else, in ways that I think would have Madison, Jefferson and other founders rolling in their grave,” said Huffman, who calls himself a “nonreligious humanist” and, along with Raskin, helped found the Congressional Freethought Caucus. The letter seeks answers about how Hibbs was approved to lead the prayer and whether Johnson and the chaplain’s office flouted existing guidelines. Instructions given to member offices say guest chaplains must be from the sponsoring member’s congressional district and be known personally by the member. They also say the sponsoring member should plan on giving the first One Minute Speech of the day to personally welcome the guest chaplain. Members are limited to one guest chaplain per Congress, and dates for such a prayer must align with the last legislative day of the week. Hibbs leads Calvary Chapel Chino Hills, which is located in Southern California, not in Johnson’s district in Louisiana, and the letter details other deviations from the guidelines. The speaker’s office did not respond to a request for comment. During his time in Washington at the end of January, Hibbs appears to have attended other events, including the National Gathering for Prayer and Repentance. Johnson and several other members of Congress also attended that gathering, which was organized by the Family Research Council and held at the Museum of the Bible. Huffman wants to know why Hibbs was invited to lead the House in prayer while some members, according to the letter, have had requests for other guest chaplains denied. The letter mentions a nontheistic chaplain from Pocan’s district, Dan Barker. House chaplains open every session of the House with a prayer and perform various pastoral duties for members. “In terms of … what he said and the full context of who [Hibbs] is, it doesn’t meet the standards. So definitely Chaplain Kibben was either asleep at the switch or allowed something that should have been disqualifying under her own standards,” Huffman said, referring to Margaret Kibben, who has held the chaplain’s post since 2021. The chaplain’s office declined to comment. Huffman said he hasn’t received a response yet from either Johnson’s office or the chaplain but is eager to get his questions answered. “I think they have some explaining to do,” Huffman said.

The U.S. Transgender Survey from the National Center for Transgender Equality assessed 92,329 people who identify as trans or nonbinary from Oct. 19 through Dec. 5, 2022. The survey included more than 84,000 people aged 18 and older and was also open to individuals aged 16 and older. The study claims that 94% of participants who lived under a different gender identity reported they were “a lot more satisfied” (79%) or “a little more satisfied” (15%) with their life. The study does not appear to have included individuals who detransitioned in its analysis, however.Three percent of respondents reported that identifying as the opposite-sex made them “neither more nor less satisfied” with their life, while 1% reported they were “a little less satisfied.” Another 2% of participants stated that they were “a lot less satisfied” with their life.“Nearly all respondents (98%) who were taking cross-sex hormones reported that the drugs made them either ‘a lot more satisfied’ (84%) or ‘a little more satisfied’ (14%) with their life,” the study further claimed. “One percent (1%) reported that [opposite-sex] hormones made them ‘neither more nor less satisfied’ with their life, and less than 1% said they were ‘a little less satisfied’ or ‘a lot less satisfied’ with their lives after receiving hormones.” The study also purported that 97% of respondents who underwent a sex-change operation said that they were “a lot more satisfied” (88%) or “a little more satisfied” (9%) with their life. “One percent (1%) reported that surgery made them ‘neither more nor less satisfied’ with their life, less than 1% were ‘a little less satisfied,’ and 1% were ‘a lot less satisfied’ with their life,” the report claimed. However, the study’s data also show that 44% of respondents reported they had experienced what the report described as “serious psychological distress” within the last 30 days. Thirty percent of participants said they had experienced homelessness in their lifetime, and more than one-third of respondents were experiencing poverty. According to a report released by the American College of Pediatricians titled “Mental Health in Adolescents with Incongruence of Gender Identity and Biological Sex,” allowing minors to undergo such procedures does not improve their mental health. The Healthy Minds Study found that 78% of college students classified as “gender minorities” showed signs of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self-injury and suicidality compared to only 45% of respondents who were not “gender minorities.” The study surveyed 65,213 students at 71 college campuses across the U.S. between 2015 and 2017. “A 2021 comprehensive data review of all 3,754 trans-identified adolescents in U.S. military families over 8.5 years showed that cross-sex hormones led to increased use of [mental] health services and psychiatric medications, and increased suicidal ideation/attempted suicide,” the report stated.ACP board member Dr. Jane Anderson told The Christian Post in an earlier interview that “the most important thing is to recognize that these adolescents need and benefit from mental health support.”“There is a high incidence of adolescents who come into this medical care who have previous history of depression or anxiety or autism or other medical or psychological concerns,” she said. “And those issues have to be dealt with first,” she added. “It’s just crucial that they receive the mental health services and support that they so desperately need.”Samantha Kamman is a reporter for The Christian Post.

Marie Toronto Vancouver Vancouver Island Windsor Winnipeg Search CTVNews.ca Search Calgary Legal experts raise concerns about Alberta's plans for transgender youth Alberta Premier Danielle Smith arrives for a news conference in Ottawa on Monday, Feb.5, 2024. (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick) Share Thirty-six law professors, legal researchers and other staff from Alberta's two largest universities are asking the province to reconsider policy changes affecting transgender youth. The open letter, sent Thursday, was signed by staff at the University of Alberta and University of Calgary law schools. ""We have come together to express our deep concerns with the government's announcement of restrictions targeting transgender youth,"" says the letter. “These restrictions will harm two-spirit, trans, and gender diverse children and youth by undermining their education, restricting their access to health care, and narrowing their sport and recreation opportunities. “We believe these restrictions violate their rights as enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has said the fall sitting of the legislature would bring new rules, including restrictions on youth changing their names or pronouns at school, as well as on hormone treatment and surgery for gender affirmation. The province would also clamp down on transgender female athletes competing in women's and girls' sports. Smith's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Jennifer Koshan, a law professor at the University of Calgary, said she and her colleagues wrote to the UCP government because they want to shine a spotlight on the legal aspects to the debate. ""Many of these youth have been speaking out themselves and have been telling very compelling stories about their own personal circumstances and the impact that these policies would have on them,"" Koshan said in an interview. ""So, we're just trying to add to the discussion with the type of expertise that we can bring forward here, which is the legal expertise that puts all of these issues in the framework of the Charter."" The experts say the proposed changes violate multiple sections of the Charter, including freedom of expression, the right to security of the person, and say the rules may constitute cruel and unusual treatment. The letter also addresses Smith’s refusal to rule out using the Charter’s notwithstanding clause to push through the changes. “We believe that it would be wrong for the government to invoke the notwithstanding clause to force through legislation that violates the Charter rights of minors,” said the letter. The legal experts note the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized the transgender community as a marginalized group in Canadian society. ""Two-spirit, trans, and gender diverse youth are especially vulnerable,"" says the letter. ""They depend on adults to care for them. Too often, adults in their lives are not prepared to accept and care for them because of who they are. They are bullied. They are subject to violence and gender-based victimization. ""The Charter has a critical role to play in protecting them, given their heightened vulnerability."" The transgender policies have spurred protests — both at the grassroots level and from professional groups such as the Alberta Medical Association. There was a student walkout at high schools across the province last week to show support to students who would be affected by the policies. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 15, 2024.

The open letter is from staff at the University of Alberta and University of Calgary law schools.Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has said the fall sitting of the legislature would bring new rules, including parental notifications and/or consent for youth changing their names or pronouns at school, as well as restricting access to hormone treatment and surgery for gender-affirming healthcare.The province would also clamp down on transgender female athletes competing in women’s and girls’ sports.The letter says the proposed policies would be unconstitutional and infringe on the rights and freedoms enshrined in four different sections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms: freedom of expression in section 2(b), the right to life, liberty and security of the person in section 7, the right to not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in section 12, and equality rights in section 15. Story continues below advertisement “Protecting fundamental freedoms, safeguarding legal and equality rights, and respecting human dignity are guiding principles of Canadian society. Infringing Charter rights and freedoms undermines our collective aspirations and diminishes all of us,” the open letter reads.The legal scholars also said any use of the Charter’s notwithstanding clause would be “wholly unnecessary” if the government believes the restrictions are in the best interests of trans youth, and that using that section of the Charter would be needed if the government believes “neither the science nor the human rights are on their side.”The law professors said they received confirmation of receipt from the offices of the premier and ministries they sent the letter to. More on Politics Alexei Navalny death reports ‘tragic and horrifying,’ Justin Trudeau says Saskatchewan judge OKs pronoun law challenge NDP close to presenting ‘final offer’ on pharmacare: Singh MPs urge Loblaw, Walmart to sign grocery code of conduct or risk it becoming law Late Thursday, the premier’s office responded to the open letter.“Alberta’s government has put these policies forward and will develop legislation with the best interests of the child in mind,” Smith’s press secretary Sam Blackett wrote. “There’s a legal court process that designates certain individuals as mature minors in very limited circumstances, these policies will not change that process.”Without seeing the drafted or final language of the policies, the law professors and legal researchers said they are only able to go on what Smith has said about the types of restrictions her government plans to implement.“We do think the policies are unconstitutional,” U of C law professor Jennifer Koshan said. “We think there are strong arguments that those policies, once they’re put into writing, would violate the Charter.” Story continues below advertisement “There is a sense that these types of policies are really chipping away at the respect for human rights and respect for the Charter and the Constitution that we have in Canada that are really meant to protect minority groups from majoritarian rule,” U of A assistant professor of law Florence Ashley said.While expressing concern for trans kids, Smith has previously said the policies are intended to protect the choices a youth could make about altering their body until they’ve “grown mature enough to make such choices safely, and with a full understanding of what that means for the rest of your life.”“We have to preserve the rights of kids to be able to make decisions as adults,” Smith said on Feb. 1. “We’re aiming to be supportive of children’s rights. We want to make sure that children do not prematurely make decisions that are going to be irreversible.“We think that this is preserving of choice.” 2:54 Danielle Smith unveils Alberta’s proposed guidelines on parental consent, gender-affirming care rules Danielle Smith unveils Alberta’s proposed guidelines on parental consent, gender-affirming care rules Alberta NDP: Smith ‘playing dangerous politics’ in wake of provincial gender pronoun policy Smith using ‘mean-spirited’ gender pronoun policy to ‘distract’ Albertans from provincial issues: Notley Previous Video Next Video Story continues below advertisement Freedom of expression The legal scholars said requiring parental approval and/or notification for name or pronoun changes at school would violate the freedom of gender expression, a fundamental freedom in section 2(b) of the Charter.“Denying youth access to care violates their rights to autonomy and freedom of expression,” the legal scholars wrote. 5:18 Comparing Saskatchewan and Alberta’s parental consent policy Life, liberty and security of the person The open letter said that will cause youth to either misgender themselves at school or out themselves to potentially non-supportive parents, causing “significant harm” and would be a “cruel choice” that violates their section 7 rights to “make fundamental personal decisions and be free from state-imposed psychological distress.” Story continues below advertisement The law professors noted a Saskatchewan court granted an injunction to prevent “irreparable harm” to trans and gender-diverse youth from a similar policy. Get the latest National news. Sent to your email, every day. The Saskatchewan government would later use the notwithstanding clause to put that policy into law.Another “serious violation” of the right to life, liberty and security of the person, the letter said, would be in the government imposing a medical decision by prohibiting “standard-of-care interventions” of gender-affirming care, the letter said.Under the mature minor doctrine of common law, youth who understand a medical procedure and its possible consequences can legally make that decision.Already in Canada, youth must be the age of 18 before having “bottom surgery.”The letter quoted a 2009 Supreme Court decision that said “young people should not automatically be deprived of the right to make decisions affecting their medical treatment,” but are instead “entitled to a degree of decision-making autonomy that is reflective of their evolving intelligence and understanding.”Smith was asked about the possibility of the new policies violating childrens’ Charter rights in accessing health care on Feb. 1.“I guess I’ll have the lawyers debate that out,” the premier said. “But my understanding is that it’s pretty well understood that parents are principally responsible for their children up to and including age 15. At age 16 or 17, that’s of course when kids develop a little bit more autonomy.” Story continues below advertisement Koshan previously told Global News there’s no set age at which a child can be considered a mature minor, and is instead identified on a case-by-case basis depending on the minor’s maturity, understanding of the decision and the context of the decision.The premier claimed a mature minor making decisions was “fairly rare.”“I think that the practice has been that we do rely on parents to be able to provide for their kids,” Smith said on Feb. 1.Restricting trans women from participating along their cisgendered counterparts would “likely violate all women and girls’ rights to privacy and bodily integrity under section 7 of the Charter by encouraging practices of ‘gender verification,’” the open letter states. 2:04 Alberta LGBTQ2 community members meet with cabinet minister on gender policies ‘Cruel and unusual punishment’ The open letter said the “state-imposed psychological distress” imposed by that “cruel choice” of either self-misgendering or facing unsupportive parents would also violate youth’s right to not be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, under section 12 of the Charter. Story continues below advertisement In the video announcing the policies and at subsequent news conferences, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith appeared to be relying on existing laws to protect children from any violence that stemmed from the policies.“We have child protection laws that will be strictly enforced,” Smith said on Jan. 31.The open letter said the existing child protection legislation is “insufficient,” and would require children to report their own parents to child protection authorities.“This reliance on child protection laws is completely unrealistic and untenable, and exacerbates the violations of the Charter and human rights legislation discussed above,” the letter reads.Ashley said the child protection system in Alberta is already under stress and that the child welfare system is overburdened.“Laws need to be there in order to protect precisely those who do not feel safe telling their parents, because that’s the population that we’re actually thinking about. That’s the population that’s actually being impacted by these changes in laws,” they said. Trending Now A woman dying of cancer, and the struggle to get treatment to reduce her pain Two teens intentionally run down by Abbotsford, B.C. driver, police say The legal scholars also took umbrage with the proposed opt-in framework for in-school instruction on topics including gender identity, sexual orientation and human sexuality.“The proposed restrictions will cause harm to all youth, especially to those who are vulnerable to sexual violence, including girls and 2SLGBTQ+ youth. In addition to the Charter provisions mentioned above, the proposed scheme impacts youth’s right to access to information, which is an important aspect of freedom of expression.” Story continues below advertisement Smith said the change to opt-in was to keep parents “in the loop” about what’s being taught in schools.The legal experts also said the policies announced by social media video on Jan. 31 would be inconsistent with Indigenous law. Citing the Final Report on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls that “some First Nations also challenged European norms that understood gender as binary” and how two-spirit people were revered and included in social and ceremonial roles.“Therefore, the Government of Alberta should also be consulting with Indigenous communities about the impact of the proposed restrictions on Indigenous law,” the open letter says. 10:27 What is SOGI 123? Equality rights “By singling out a historically disadvantaged and vulnerable group for adverse impact, the restrictions also would violate the right to equality guaranteed by section 15 of the Charter and the Alberta Human Rights Act,” the letter says. Story continues below advertisement The same rights would be violated under the proposed sports policy excluding trans women from participating alongside cis women.“Such a clear distinction based on sex and gender identity unquestionably impairs the right to equality of trans women under section 15 of the Charter and under the Alberta Human Rights Act,” the letter says. “Differential treatment cannot be based on needless speculation or stereotype, but must be rooted in clear evidence of need and necessity.”On Feb. 1, Smith said her government wants to enshrine the choice of women who are assigned female at birth to be able to “participate in a biological female-only category while still preserving the gender-neutral categories and coed opportunities so that everyone has the ability to participate.” The notwithstanding clause The Alberta legal scholars said the use of section 33 of the Charter, the notwithstanding clause, allows governments to bypass Charter rights and freedoms, and severely limit the possibility of judicial review. Story continues below advertisement “If the government genuinely believes that the restrictions are in alignment with the best interests of trans youth, invoking the notwithstanding clause should be wholly unnecessary,” the letter reads. “Only if the government believes that neither science nor human rights are on their side does using section 33 become necessary.”On Feb. 1, Smith said she hopes her government won’t need to use the notwithstanding clause.On Thursday, Smith’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the possible use of that section of the Charter.Koshan said so far, the Alberta government hasn’t provided any justification for the restrictions that would fall under “reasonable limits” under section 1 of the Charter. 11:25 ‘I hope it doesn’t come to that’: Premier Smith on notwithstanding clause option for new trans policies The 36 legal experts said that lack of evidence led them to a conclusion about why the notwithstanding clause could be used. Story continues below advertisement “Using the notwithstanding clause to promote partisan political aims at the expense of a small, vulnerable group of youth would be, in our opinion, unconscionable.”Ashley said a government’s choice to use the notwithstanding clause in matters like these sends a clear message.“I think that a government that uses the notwithstanding clause is more or less admitting in almost all normal situations that this is a law that indeed violates the rights of people,” they said.That section of the Charter was included because of the possibility that voters could hold legislators responsible for a cavalier use of the notwithstanding clause.However, according to the 2021 census, only 0.67 per cent of Albertans over 15 identified as trans or non binary.“To override their rights knowing that they are too few to hold the government accountable at the ballot box would be fundamentally anti-democratic,” the legal scholars said.–with files from The Canadian Press 4:59 Alberta proposes policy changes affecting trans-gender youth Alberta proposes policy changes affecting trans-gender youth Alberta policies on trans youth most anti-LGBTQ in Canada: Trudeau ‘Standing with the bullies’: Boissonnault slams Poilievre for silence on trans youth rights Previous Video Next Video Advertisement Journalistic standards Comment Report an error © 2024 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts ""We have come together to express our deep concerns with the government's announcement of restrictions targeting transgender youth,"" says the letter. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ""These restrictions will harm two-spirit, trans, and gender diverse children and youth by undermining their education, restricting their access to health care, and narrowing their sport and recreation opportunities.""We believe these restrictions violate their rights as enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.""Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has said the fall sitting of the legislature would bring new rules, including restrictions on youth changing their names or pronouns at school, as well as on hormone treatment and surgery for gender affirmation.The province would also clamp down on transgender female athletes competing in women's and girls' sports.Jennifer Koshan, a law professor at the University of Calgary, said she and her colleagues wrote to the UCP government because they want to shine a spotlight on the legal aspects to the debate. ""Many of these youth have been speaking out themselves and have been telling very compelling stories about their own personal circumstances and the impact that these policies would have on them,"" Koshan said in an interview.""So, we're just trying to add to the discussion with the type of expertise that we can bring forward here, which is the legal expertise that puts all of these issues in the framework of the Charter.""The experts say the proposed changes violate multiple sections of the Charter, including freedom of expression, the right to security of the person, and say the rules may constitute cruel and unusual treatment.The letter also addresses Smith’s refusal to rule out using the Charter’s notwithstanding clause to push through the changes.""We believe that it would be wrong for the government to invoke the notwithstanding clause to force through legislation that violates the Charter rights of minors,"" said the letter. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW The legal experts note the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized the transgender community as a marginalized group in Canadian society.""Two-spirit, trans, and gender diverse youth are especially vulnerable,"" says the letter.""They depend on adults to care for them. Too often, adults in their lives are not prepared to accept and care for them because of who they are. They are bullied. They are subject to violence and gender-based victimization.""The Charter has a critical role to play in protecting them, given their heightened vulnerability.""Sam Blackett, press secretary for the premier's office, acknowledged the letter in an email late Thursday afternoon. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ""Alberta's government has put these policies forward and will develop legislation with the best interests of the child in mind,"" he wrote.""There's a legal court process that designates certain individuals as mature minors in very limited circumstances, these policies will not change that process.""The transgender policies have spurred protests — both at the grassroots level and from professional groups such as the Alberta Medical Association.There was a student walkout at high schools across the province last week to show support to students who would be affected by the policies.This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 15, 2024.

The open letter, sent Thursday, was signed by staff at the University of Alberta and University of Calgary law schools. ""We have come together to express our deep concerns with the government's announcement of restrictions targeting transgender youth,"" says the letter. ""These restrictions will harm two-spirit, trans, and gender diverse children and youth by undermining their education, restricting their access to health care, and narrowing their sport and recreation opportunities. ""We believe these restrictions violate their rights as enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms."" Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has said the fall sitting of the legislature would bring new rules, including restrictions on youth changing their names or pronouns at school, as well as on hormone treatment and surgery for gender affirmation. The province would also clamp down on transgender female athletes competing in women's and girls' sports. Jennifer Koshan, a law professor at the University of Calgary, said she and her colleagues wrote to the UCP government because they want to shine a spotlight on the legal aspects to the debate. ""Many of these youth have been speaking out themselves and have been telling very compelling stories about their own personal circumstances and the impact that these policies would have on them,"" Koshan said in an interview. ""So, we're just trying to add to the discussion with the type of expertise that we can bring forward here, which is the legal expertise that puts all of these issues in the framework of the Charter."" The experts say the proposed changes violate multiple sections of the Charter, including freedom of expression, the right to security of the person, and say the rules may constitute cruel and unusual treatment. The letter also addresses Smith’s refusal to rule out using the Charter’s notwithstanding clause to push through the changes. ""We believe that it would be wrong for the government to invoke the notwithstanding clause to force through legislation that violates the Charter rights of minors,"" said the letter. The legal experts note the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized the transgender community as a marginalized group in Canadian society. ""Two-spirit, trans, and gender diverse youth are especially vulnerable,"" says the letter. ""They depend on adults to care for them. Too often, adults in their lives are not prepared to accept and care for them because of who they are. They are bullied. They are subject to violence and gender-based victimization. ""The Charter has a critical role to play in protecting them, given their heightened vulnerability."" Sam Blackett, press secretary for the premier's office, acknowledged the letter in an email late Thursday afternoon. ""Alberta's government has put these policies forward and will develop legislation with the best interests of the child in mind,"" he wrote. ""There's a legal court process that designates certain individuals as mature minors in very limited circumstances, these policies will not change that process."" The transgender policies have spurred protests — both at the grassroots level and from professional groups such as the Alberta Medical Association. There was a student walkout at high schools across the province last week to show support to students who would be affected by the policies.

Read our privacy noticeThe mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey has said the “trans hate” aimed at her daughter online is “horrendous” as she called for a crackdown on social media and mobile phone usage.Esther Ghey, 37, said she recently reported a comment about her daughter, who is transgender, on X, formerly Twitter, but the company did not take it down, finding it did not breach their policies.“I’ve done a few interviews now and once the articles are posted on Twitter, the comments are absolutely horrendous, and there’s a lot of trans hate that’s directed to Brianna,” Ms Ghey said.“Now, I’m all for free speech but I actually reported one of these comments and they came back to say that there was nothing wrong with what was being said.“It’s just complete hate and I don’t think that there’s a place online for that.”Brianna’s mother Esther Ghey is calling for a crackdown on social media and mobile phone usage (PA)Brianna, 16, was brutally stabbed to death by Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both now aged 16 but who were 15 at the time, after they lured her to Culcheth Linear Park near Warrington on 11 February last year.The harrowing four-week trial at Manchester Crown Court heard how the “warped” pair had a fascination for violence, torture and murder, and shared a “thirst for killing”, with Jenkinson downloading a browser allowing her to search the “dark web” for “red rooms” showing real-life torture and killing videos.After the pair were sentenced to life imprisonment earlier this month, Brianna’s mother Esther Ghey, 37, began campaigning for improved safeguarding of children against the risks of accessing harmful content online, including an age limit for smartphone usage and stricter controls on access to social media apps. Ms Ghey said it was “absolutely shocking that a young person can access the dark web”.Brianna herself accessed eating-disorder and self-harm content on X, which worsened her mental health struggles.Ms Ghey said companies such as X have a “moral responsibility” to protect young people from harm online, and she believes the Online Safety Act does not go far enough.Brianna, 16, was brutally stabbed to death in Culcheth Linear Park near Warrington on 11 February last year (PA Wire)She said “nothing is in the diary yet” regarding a potential meeting with prime minister Rishi Sunak, but added: “I am hoping to arrange something soon after I’ve had a short break.”She said she would like to “get his views” on online safety for young people and to discuss her Peace in Mind campaign to train more teachers in mindfulness.Referring to the comments made about her daughter, Ms Ghey expressed concern for children and young people seeing “this hateful way of speaking” and she would “like to sit down and speak to the regulators and social media companies”.“(Social media companies) have got us into this mess now and it is their responsibility to get us out of it, and it’s something that we can all work on together,” she said.“Social media companies and mobile phone companies have both got a moral responsibility to not think about profit so much and actually think about how their product is impacting the people who are using it.”Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both now aged 16 but who were 15 at the time, murdered Brianna after they lured her to Culcheth Linear Park near Warrington on 11 February last year (PA Media)Ms Ghey’s comments came as she announced £75,000 had been raised by Peace in Mind to train more teachers in mindfulness, a cognitive skill focused on being in the present moment.The campaign has raised enough money for a teacher in every school in her town of Warrington, Cheshire, to be trained in mindfulness, with ambitions to spread the campaign around the country.“I feel that if we did have mindfulness in schools from a young age then that may have made [Brianna] more resilient, and she would have been less at risk of the things that she was going through when she was a teenager,” Ms Ghey said.Ms Ghey recently discussed her campaign to get mindfulness taught in schools with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, which she said was “a really positive meeting”, although Sir Keir did not commit to banning smartphones for young people if Labour won the general election.“We explained about mindfulness and how we would like to get into schools, and we gave him a roundabout costing and he would like to get more information and is happy to receive how much it would actually cost,” Ms Ghey said.“I suppose that I understand that he can’t commit without having all of the information there, so I think the fact that he’s asked for that information is a very positive step in the right direction.”Ms Ghey recently discussed her campaign to get mindfulness taught in schools with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer (Getty Images)Ms Ghey has found strength in building her daughter’s legacy, but added: “Obviously, I have bad days and my daughter struggles quite a bit still.“We’ve completely changed our lives so we don’t notice the hole where Brianna was quite so much.“We really made a conscious effort to remember her for all the good things and to remember her for who she was.”Emily Slater, chief executive of the Mindfulness in Schools Project, which is receiving funds raised by Ms Ghey’s Peace in Mind campaign to train more teachers in mindfulness, said: “We have a fantastic representative in Esther, for parents and for common sense, and I think we’d be hard pressed to find many families at the moment, many parents, that aren’t asking themselves questions about mobile phone use or the wellbeing of their children and young people.”Ms Ghey also on Thursday met Ian Russell, the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in November 2017 after viewing harmful material on social media.Speaking together to the BBC, Mr Russell told Ms Ghey that while “it’s never been that easy to be a teenager”, social media was providing a fresh challenge for young people to navigate.He said: “We both lost children who had seen harmful things online and, in your case, there were other children involved who had been motivated to murder by what they’d seen online.“It’s almost impossible for a parent to monitor and mirror and know what their children are doing and keep up with all the evolutions in all the tech platforms.”The Independent has approached X for comment.More aboutBrianna GheyRishi SunakTwitterGovernmentLabourCheshireWarringtonMolly Russell1/5Mother says ‘trans hate’ targeting Brianna Ghey online

It’s beyond belief really.”Ms Ghey plans to meet the mother of Scarlett Jenkinson, one of her daughter’s murderers, although a date has not yet been arranged.“When I do meet her, it’s going to be a very personal and very private thing between both of us,” she said.Ms Ghey’s comments came as she announced £75,000 had been raised by Peace in Mind to train more teachers in mindfulness, a cognitive skill focused on being in the present moment.The campaign has raised enough money for a teacher in every school in her town of Warrington, Cheshire, to be trained in mindfulness, with ambitions to spread the campaign around the country.“I feel that if we did have mindfulness in schools from a young age then that may have made [Brianna] more resilient, and she would have been less at risk of the things that she was going through when she was a teenager,” Ms Ghey said.Ms Ghey recently discussed her campaign to get mindfulness taught in schools with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, which she said was “a really positive meeting”, although Sir Keir did not commit to banning smartphones for young people if Labour won the general election.“We explained about mindfulness and how we would like to get into schools, and we gave him a roundabout costing and he would like to get more information and is happy to receive how much it would actually cost,” Ms Ghey said.“I suppose that I understand that he can’t commit without having all of the information there, so I think the fact that he’s asked for that information is a very positive step in the right direction.”Ms Ghey has found strength in building her daughter’s legacy, but added: “Obviously, I have bad days and my daughter struggles quite a bit still.“We’ve completely changed our lives so we don’t notice the hole where Brianna was quite so much.“We really made a conscious effort to remember her for all the good things and to remember her for who she was.”Emily Slater, chief executive of the Mindfulness in Schools Project, which is receiving funds raised by Ms Ghey’s Peace in Mind campaign to train more teachers in mindfulness, said: “We have a fantastic representative in Esther, for parents and for common sense, and I think we’d be hard pressed to find many families at the moment, many parents, that aren’t asking themselves questions about mobile phone use or the wellbeing of their children and young people.”Ms Ghey also on Thursday met Ian Russell, the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in November 2017 after viewing harmful material on social media.Speaking together to the BBC, Mr Russell told Ms Ghey that while “it’s never been that easy to be a teenager”, social media was providing a fresh challenge for young people to navigate.He said: “We both lost children who had seen harmful things online and, in your case, there were other children involved who had been motivated to murder by what they’d seen online.“It’s almost impossible for a parent to monitor and mirror and know what their children are doing and keep up with all the evolutions in all the tech platforms.”X did not offer a response when contacted by PA.

Brianna, 16, a transgender girl, died after being stabbed 28 times in a park by teenagers Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe earlier this year. A judge concluded a 'secondary motive' for the killing 'was hostility towards Brianna because of her transgender identity'. Brianna's mum Esther Ghey, 37, said comments on articles posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, following her daughter's death have been 'absolutely horrendous' and 'absolute hate'. She told the PA news agency she reported a comment about her daughter on the social media platform, but the company did not take it down, finding it did not breach their policies. Join our WhatsApp Top Stories and Breaking News group by clicking this link. Ms Ghey said companies such as X have a 'moral responsibility' to protect young people from harm online, after her daughter Brianna, struggled with her mental health, which was worsened by accessing eating-disorder and self-harm content on the platform. She also said 'nothing is in the diary yet' regarding a potential meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, but added: ""I am hoping to arrange something soon after I've had a short break."" She said she would like to 'get his views' on online safety for young people and to discuss her Peace in Mind campaign to train more teachers in mindfulness. ""I've done a few interviews now and once the articles are posted on Twitter, the comments are absolutely horrendous, and there's a lot of trans hate that's directed to Brianna,"" Ms Ghey said. ""Now, I'm all for free speech but I actually reported one of these comments and they came back to say that there was nothing wrong with what was being said. It's just complete hate and I don't think that there's a place online for that."" Brianna Ghey (Image: PA) Ms Ghey expressed concern for children and young people seeing 'this hateful way of speaking' and she would 'like to sit down and speak to the regulators and social media companies'. ""(Social media companies) have got us into this mess now and it is their responsibility to get us out of it, and it's something that we can all work on together,"" she said. ""Social media companies and mobile phone companies have both got a moral responsibility to not think about profit so much and actually think about how their product is impacting the people who are using it."" She is campaigning for an age limit for smartphone usage and stricter controls on access to social media apps. Asked what she thought of X owner Elon Musk describing himself as a 'free speech absolutist', she added: ""If people can comment on posts that young people are putting up in such a disgusting way and when you report it, nothing happens, it's a bit of a ridiculous title to call himself."" Ms Ghey said the Online Safety Act does not go far enough. Asked what she would say to those in Government and elsewhere who have said the Bill is strong enough to protect young people, Ms Ghey said: ""Would they still be happy for their children to be scrolling on social media for the amount of time that most children are scrolling on social media once the act is in place? ""I think that, probably, I wouldn't be."" One of Brianna's murderers accessed violent content on the dark web a part of the internet which allows users to be untraceable as they plotted to kill the teenager, and Ms Ghey said it was 'absolutely shocking that a young person can access the dark web'. She said: ""Before all of this I didn't even realise that the dark web was actually a thing. I thought it was like something that was just made up in films, and the fact that somebody who is 15 can access it is so disturbing, and it's so worrying. It's beyond belief really."" Ms Ghey plans to meet the mother of Scarlett Jenkinson, one of her daughter's murderers, although a date has not yet been arranged. ""When I do meet her, it's going to be a very personal and very private thing between both of us,"" she said. Ms Ghey's comments came as she announced £75,000 had been raised by Peace in Mind to train more teachers in mindfulness, a cognitive skill focused on being in the present moment. The campaign has raised enough money for a teacher in every school in her town of Warrington, Cheshire, to be trained in mindfulness, with ambitions to spread the campaign around the country. ""I feel that if we did have mindfulness in schools from a young age then that may have made [Brianna] more resilient, and she would have been less at risk of the things that she was going through when she was a teenager,"" Ms Ghey said. Ms Ghey recently discussed her campaign to get mindfulness taught in schools with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, which she said was 'a really positive meeting', although Sir Keir did not commit to banning smartphones for young people if Labour won the general election. ""We explained about mindfulness and how we would like to get into schools, and we gave him a roundabout costing and he would like to get more information and is happy to receive how much it would actually cost,"" Ms Ghey said.

(Image: PA Wire/PA Images) ""I suppose that I understand that he can't commit without having all of the information there, so I think the fact that he's asked for that information is a very positive step in the right direction."" Ms Ghey has found strength in building her daughter's legacy, but added: ""Obviously, I have bad days and my daughter struggles quite a bit still."" ""We've completely changed our lives so we don't notice the hole where Brianna was quite so much. We really made a conscious effort to remember her for all the good things and to remember her for who she was."" Emily Slater, chief executive of the Mindfulness in Schools Project, which is receiving funds raised by Ms Ghey's Peace in Mind campaign to train more teachers in mindfulness, said: ""We have a fantastic representative in Esther, for parents and for common sense, and I think we'd be hard pressed to find many families at the moment, many parents, that aren't asking themselves questions about mobile phone use or the wellbeing of their children and young people.""

Esther Ghey has spoken to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and said she plans to meet Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ‘soon’ (Lucy North/PA)Aisling Grace3 minutes agoThe mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey has said the “trans hate” aimed at her daughter when articles about her are posted on social media is “horrendous”.Esther Ghey, 37, told the PA news agency she reported a comment about her daughter on X, formerly Twitter, but the company did not take it down, finding it did not breach their policies.Ms Ghey said companies such as X have a “moral responsibility” to protect young people from harm online, after her daughter Brianna, who was transgender, struggled with her mental health, which was worsened by accessing eating-disorder and self-harm content on the platform.She also said “nothing is in the diary yet” regarding a potential meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, but added: “I am hoping to arrange something soon after I’ve had a short break.”She said she would like to “get his views” on online safety for young people and to discuss her Peace in Mind campaign to train more teachers in mindfulness.“I’ve done a few interviews now and once the articles are posted on Twitter, the comments are absolutely horrendous, and there’s a lot of trans hate that’s directed to Brianna,” Ms Ghey said.“Now, I’m all for free speech but I actually reported one of these comments and they came back to say that there was nothing wrong with what was being said.“It’s just complete hate and I don’t think that there’s a place online for that.”Ms Ghey expressed concern for children and young people seeing “this hateful way of speaking” and she would “like to sit down and speak to the regulators and social media companies”.“(Social media companies) have got us into this mess now and it is their responsibility to get us out of it, and it’s something that we can all work on together,” she said.Read MoreNigel Farage says he 'might' return to lead Reform UK after by-election resultsKeir Starmer admits last week was ‘bumpy’ but insists Labour is a changed partyWellingborough and Kingswood ‘particularly challenging’, PM insists after defeatSponsoredFirst look at exceptional new London properties for sale in 2024“Social media companies and mobile phone companies have both got a moral responsibility to not think about profit so much and actually think about how their product is impacting the people who are using it.”She is campaigning for an age limit for smartphone usage and stricter controls on access to social media apps.Asked what she thought of X owner Elon Musk describing himself as a “free speech absolutist”, she added: “If people can comment on posts that young people are putting up in such a disgusting way and when you report it, nothing happens, it’s a bit of a ridiculous title to call himself.”Ms Ghey said the Online Safety Act does not go far enough.Asked what she would say to those in Government and elsewhere who have said the Bill is strong enough to protect young people, Ms Ghey said: “Would they still be happy for their children to be scrolling on social media for the amount of time that most children are scrolling on social media once the act is in place?“I think that, probably, I wouldn’t be.”One of Brianna’s murderers accessed violent content on the dark web – a part of the internet which allows users to be untraceable – as they plotted to kill the teenager, and Ms Ghey said it was “absolutely shocking that a young person can access the dark web”.She said: “Before all of this I didn’t even realise that the dark web was actually a thing.“I thought it was like something that was just made up in films, and the fact that somebody who is 15 can access it is so disturbing, and it’s so worrying. It’s beyond belief really.”Ms Ghey plans to meet the mother of Scarlett Jenkinson, one of her daughter’s murderers, although a date has not yet been arranged.“When I do meet her, it’s going to be a very personal and very private thing between both of us,” she said.Ms Ghey’s comments came as she announced £75,000 had been raised by Peace in Mind to train more teachers in mindfulness, a cognitive skill focused on being in the present moment.The campaign has raised enough money for a teacher in every school in her town of Warrington, Cheshire, to be trained in mindfulness, with ambitions to spread the campaign around the country.“I feel that if we did have mindfulness in schools from a young age then that may have made [Brianna] more resilient, and she would have been less at risk of the things that she was going through when she was a teenager,” Ms Ghey said.Ms Ghey recently discussed her campaign to get mindfulness taught in schools with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, which she said was “a really positive meeting”, although Sir Keir did not commit to banning smartphones for young people if Labour won the general election.“We explained about mindfulness and how we would like to get into schools, and we gave him a roundabout costing and he would like to get more information and is happy to receive how much it would actually cost,” Ms Ghey said.“I suppose that I understand that he can’t commit without having all of the information there, so I think the fact that he’s asked for that information is a very positive step in the right direction.”Ms Ghey has found strength in building her daughter’s legacy, but added: “Obviously, I have bad days and my daughter struggles quite a bit still.“We’ve completely changed our lives so we don’t notice the hole where Brianna was quite so much.“We really made a conscious effort to remember her for all the good things and to remember her for who she was.”I have bad days and my daughter struggles quite a bit stillEsther GheyEmily Slater, chief executive of the Mindfulness in Schools Project, which is receiving funds raised by Ms Ghey’s Peace in Mind campaign to train more teachers in mindfulness, said: “We have a fantastic representative in Esther, for parents and for common sense, and I think we’d be hard pressed to find many families at the moment, many parents, that aren’t asking themselves questions about mobile phone use or the wellbeing of their children and young people.”Ms Ghey also on Thursday met Ian Russell, the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in November 2017 after viewing harmful material on social media.Speaking together to the BBC, Mr Russell told Ms Ghey that while “it’s never been that easy to be a teenager”, social media was providing a fresh challenge for young people to navigate.He said: “We both lost children who had seen harmful things online and, in your case, there were other children involved who had been motivated to murder by what they’d seen online.“It’s almost impossible for a parent to monitor and mirror and know what their children are doing and keep up with all the evolutions in all the tech platforms.”X did not offer a response when contacted by PA.MORE ABOUTKeir StarmerRishi SunakTwitterElon MuskMindGovernmentLabourCheshireWarringtonMolly RussellBBCMost Read 1 Showbiz Steve Wright: Friend of radio DJ says he 'died of a broken heart' after his show was axed by BBC 2 Showbiz Steve Wright's brother says BBC DJ 'hid health issues' as he discusses cause of death 3 Transport London Overground rebrand: Lioness, Windrush and Suffragette among new names in £6million redesign of 'Orange Line' 4 Crime Thousands of drivers tricked by fake 50mph sign on A20 must pay fines, say police 5 UK British mum-of-three warns 'right to fall in love with foreigner only for the rich' as Home Office visa changes set to separate her family Voucher Codes£100 off all bookings over £1000 - TUI discount code20% off everything with this ASOS app discount code5% off all bookings with this Travelodge discount code20% off everything with The Body Shop discount code15% of all orders with The Perfume Shop birthday discountNewsSportBusinessLifestyleCultureGoing OutHomes & PropertyCommentNewslettersAll TopicsAll AuthorsArchiveTerms of useContact UsModern Slavery ActSyndicationPrivacy NoticePrivacy OptionsCookie PolicyCode of conduct and complaintsAdvertisersPromotion RulesContributorsLondon LiveThe IndependentThe Independent USindy100Voucher codes "

Follow: Education policy See all topics The Utah State Capitol is shown on March 3, 2023, in Salt Lake City. Rick Bowmer/AP CNN — Utah’s State Legislature has voted to censure a state board of education member whose social media post last week appeared to raise questions about a high school girl’s gender. Natalie Cline, a member of the Utah State Board of Education since 2020, posted a photo of the high school basketball player and falsely implied the student is transgender, writing: “Girls’ basketball…” The teenage girl in Utah faced threats after Cline’s posts, which drew condemnation from Gov. Spencer Cox and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson – who both urged state education officials to hold her accountable. On Wednesday, the Utah State Board of Education approved a resolution to censure Cline, stripping her of committee assignments and asking her to resign, according to a news release. “The Board voted to request Member Cline’s resignation from the Board by February 19, 2024,” the board said in the release. “Additionally, she will be removed from all committee assignments, not be allowed to place items on upcoming Board agendas, and prohibited from attending any Board advisory committee meetings.” Both houses of Utah’s Legislature on Thursday passed a censure resolution against Cline, saying that her “bullying and failure to treat a student with dignity and respect undermine the mission of the USBE and displays a selfish indifference to her sworn oath to discharge her board member duties with fidelity.” “Cline’s abhorrent actions caused the student emotional harm and exposed the student to relentless harassment and bullying, including threats of violence that created a need for additional security at the student’s school,” the resolution says.

I’ve spoken with the student’s parents and I’m heartbroken for this family. We agree with the actions of both the State Board of Education and Legislature, and we hope the voters will hold her equally accountable this fall,” the governor’s office wrote. CNN has reached out to Cline for comment. After Cline’s social media posts, the parents of the high school girl urged Cline to resign from the school board, telling CNN affiliate KSL that their daughter is a tomboy who has short hair, wears baggy clothing and has muscles from going to the gym. “To look at someone’s outer appearance and make an assumption that they’re either playing in the right arena or not, based on how someone looks I don’t think is appropriate,” the girl’s mother told KSL. “It just broke our hearts that we needed to have this conversation with our daughter.” Cline last week issued a public apology in a Facebook post that also pointed to her free speech rights. “My deepest apologies for the negative attention my post drew to innocent students and their families,” she wrote.

Laura Oliverio/CNN Related article Anguish lingers as transgender kids’ families seek medical care outside Texas — and fight a state ban In the post, which has the header “Constitutionally Protected Speech,” Cline says she removed her original post to protect the player after parents raised concerns, and she asserted she “never claimed the student was a boy.” “She does have a larger build, like her parents,” Cline said of the high school girl. “We live in strange times when it is normal to pause and wonder if people are what they say they are because of the push to normalize transgenderism in our society.” Cline’s statements came after a record-breaking year for anti-LGBTQ legislation and the enactments of new laws targeting transgender people around the country. In 2022, the Utah legislature banned transgender girls from competing in high school sports. The bill was vetoed by Cox, who said it targeted a marginalized group with a high suicide rate, but in March of that year GOP lawmakers overrode the governor’s veto.

It says her actions “violate the moral and ethical standards expected of an elected official, particularly one charged with the duty to support our children in public education.”“Now, therefore,” the resolution reads, “be it resolved that the Legislature of the state of Utah, the Governor concurring therein, condemns and denounces board member Cline’s repugnant attack on a student in the strongest possible terms and finds such behavior irreconcilable with the responsibilities of a Utah State Board of Education member.”In a statement responding to the vote, the student’s father, Al van der Beeken, said, “It’s not the resolution we were hoping for, but it’s a step in the right direction.”He continued, saying the family is waiting to see if Cline answers calls to resign, adding, “It might send a bigger message if the people of Utah have had their eyes opened a little more as a result of this and don’t reelect her. Our state and our children deserve to be represented by people we can trust and that don’t undermine and bully our children.”Sandy Republican Rep. Robert Spendlove opened a file to create the resolution last week, with Senate Majority Whip Ann Millner also sponsoring the resolution in the Senate.Spendlove said on the House floor Thursday that his resolution didn’t open impeachment proceedings against Cline because the Utah State Board of Education had already stripped her of the majority of her duties. The state school board voted Wednesday evening to request that Cline resign from her seat.While lawmakers over and over called the resolution censuring Cline “historical,” it does not include binding consequences.Because the Legislature censured Cline rather than impeaching her, the GOP school board member will be able to remain on the ballot and participate in the Salt Lake County Republican Party’s nominating convention in April. The primary election is in June.Cox signed the bill shortly after it passed, saying in a statement that he agrees with the Legislature’s actions. He acknowledged the possibility of her reelection, saying, “we hope the voters will hold her equally accountable this fall.”In his monthly appearance on PBS Utah earlier Thursday, Cox expressed thoughts similar to Spendlove’s.“What happened yesterday has effectively removed her from any actions with the board,” Cox told reporters. “Whether or not she’s impeached is probably immaterial at this point because that is, in effect, what happened.”Two representatives — Blanding Republican Rep. Phil Lyman and West Valley City Democratic Rep. Brett Garner — voted against the resolution. Lyman said in a text Thursday afternoon that “Cline’s social media activity, in my observation, did not warrant legislative involvement,” adding that he “validate[s] the feelings of” the student and her family.As Spendlove explained why the Legislature was not impeaching, Garner shook his head in apparent disappointment. He told reporters after the vote that he did not feel a censure was a severe enough consequence.After the House vote, the Utah Senate unanimously passed the resolution.Democrats were largely not included in the discussions as to what action lawmakers should take against Cline — the majority of which happened in caucus meetings. As the House prepared to vote on it, Minority Leader Angela Romero repeatedly mouthed, “no,” while making eye contact with House Speaker Mike Schultz.(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) House Minority Leader Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City, speaks as House Democrats hold a news conference to address the Natalie Cline situation at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Feb. 15, 2024.During a news conference after the resolution passed, Romero said she had prepared a substitute resolution that would have started impeachment proceedings. That substitute was not brought up for debate.“We’re here talking to the community now, letting the community know that we heard them and we wanted to start the proceedings to impeach Natalie Cline, but weren’t given the opportunity on the floor today,” Romero said.Schultz told reporters in a separate news conference that the substitute was not considered because lawmakers voted to end debate on the resolution. That decision was made with a voice vote, not a roll call vote, so it’s unclear how many lawmakers may have supported continuing debate and hearing the substitute.Prior to the resolution becoming public, Schultz said Thursday morning that the Republican caucus was “scattered” on how it wanted to approach the issue “so we’re trying to narrow everybody’s thoughts.” The body “could swing one way or the other” on impeachment, he added.The House and Senate Republicans met in a caucus meeting Thursday afternoon, prior to the resolution being made public.Impeachment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members of both the House and the Senate. “There was some support in our body for impeachment, but there was not enough even for a majority vote,” Schultz said after the resolution passed.The student athlete’s parents did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposed censure.What the student’s parents have saidOne reason members of the House were hesitant to impeach Cline, Schultz told reporters Thursday, is because the controversy then “blows up like a mushroom cloud on a national stage,” and would result in further harassment of the student and her family.He maintained that position following the vote, saying, “Impeachment is a political process that we felt like would put that girl and her family in the middle of a tug of war of sorts, and become a political football, and I don’t think that’s what’s best for the girl, for the family, or, honestly, I don’t think it’s right to give Natalie Cline a national platform to speak from.”But the student’s parents asked Republican House lawmakers to impeach Cline in a closed caucus meeting two days before the resolution was made public, van der Beek told The Salt Lake Tribune.When asked whether he had a conversation with the family in which they changed their position prior to the vote, Schultz said he had talked with the family, but didn’t indicate their position on censure.On Thursday morning, Schultz initially mischaracterized to reporters what the family had told representatives about their wishes.“The family has expressed that they have trust and faith in God, and in the process, and that they would be OK — you know, that it’s in God’s hands, they’re going to let it play out,” Schultz said.After a reporter pointed out that the student’s parents wrote in an op-ed published in The Tribune on Thursday morning that they “are asking that, following an adequate due process, we can move towards impeachment of Natalie Cline,” Schultz amended his response.“I know, they mentioned that to myself and to my caucus,” Schultz said. “But at the end of the day, they said they’re comfortable with the process and they placed it in God’s hands.”Following Schultz’s weekly meeting with journalists, van der Beek said in a call with The Tribune that “essentially, that’s what we expressed to them,” but said in making those remarks, he and his wife were referring to themselves — not the Legislature.“We do believe that it’s really not in our control,” van der Beek said. “We just felt like it was an opportunity for us to express our desire what we would like to happen,” which, he added, is impeachment.Van der Beek continued, “We just continue to move forward and if it’s not resignation, if it’s not impeachment, which of course is our desire, then I guess the next thing is just to let the voters vote, and do what we can to help support putting someone else in her place at the end of this year.”— Salt Lake Tribune political correspondent Bryan Schott contributed to this story.eanderson@sltrib.comFollow @emilyreandersonDonate to the newsroom now.

Robert Spendlove said he sponsored the resolution with “a heavy heart,” noting he could not find another instance in which the House censured a public official.“No child should be bullied,” he said.For days, House and Senate leaders had said all options to sanction Cline were under consideration, including impeachment—which would remove her from the board, and ban her from future political office in Utah.“I wish we were doing something stronger, but I’m glad we’re taking this step,” said Rep. Carol Spackman-Moss, D-Holladay.Addressing Cline has been the focus of legislative attention—and one lawmaker noted it hasn’t taken time from other business.“Instead we have to spend our time on someone taking such reckless action,” said Rep. Jordan Tuescher, R-Salt Lake County. “I’m disgusted. She blasted an innocent childit’s just wrong.”At a news conference, Democrats said they wanted impeachment instead—to keep Cline from holding public office again in Utah.The Senate vote to censure was unanimous.Gov. Spencer Cox signed the resolution for censure hours later saying Cline's behavior was ""unacceptable.""“The vast majority of Utahns agree that Natalie Cline’s behavior was unacceptable. I’ve spoken with the student’s parents and I’m heartbroken for this family. We agree with the actions of both the State Board of Education and Legislature, and we hope the voters will hold her equally accountable this fall.”Following the announcement, the Utah Senate Minority Caucus issued a statement on Thursday.""We want to express our appreciation for the swift and decisive action in passing this resolution. We are assured in knowing that we still retain the option of impeachment. Censuring Ms. Cline is just the first step in stopping her.We are glad that we could have come together on this and stand united in censuring an individual that has a lengthy history of hateful and discriminatory rhetoric, including homophobic, transphobic, and racist comments.

It is the first time in state history that a sitting state office holder has been censured by the Utah State Legislature.""Natalie Cline recklessly used her social media platform to bully a child,"" said Rep. Robert Spendlove, R-Sandy, who sponsored the resolution.Cline, an outspoken social conservative, has been condemned on Utah's Capitol Hill for a Facebook post she made insinuating that a high school student athlete is transgender. She is not. As a result of the social media post, the girl's family has received harassment that continues to this day. At one point, the girl was receiving security protection.The resolution stops short of impeachment, which is something some in the House and Senate had been pushing for. But lawmakers lined up to condemn Cline's behavior.Rep. Susan Pulsipher, R-West Jordan, said elected officials' ""actions do matter.""""What has happened here? Cannot be tolerated,"" said a visibly emotional Rep. Dan Johnson, R-Logan, a retired school principal.Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-West Jordan, pointed out to his House colleagues that Cline is the school board member for his district. He rallied lawmakers in support of the censure.""We have to spend our time with someone who has taken such reckless action that there is no other option for us to take out this time and call out what we see is real evil,"" he told the House.It passed the House on a 71-2 vote. Rep. Phil Lyman, R-Blanding, told FOX 13 News he believed the resolution went too far and voters should decide Cline's fate.""I'm not a big fan of condemnation and I felt like this one had enough political implications, motivation I felt the legislature should respectfully decline to participate in that,"" he said, acknowledging that his colleagues felt otherwise.Rep. Brett Garner, D-West Valley City voted against the censure motion because it didn't go far enough.""I feel like this resolution was an endorsement of Board member Cline's actions. Her continued actions. Not a censure at all,"" he told reporters after the vote.House Democrats were frustrated there was no impeachment. Minority Leader Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City, said their efforts to introduce articles of impeachment were ignored. ""[Cline's] refusal to acknowledge and address her actions through resignation is very disappointing and censorship can only do so much,"" Rep. Romero said. In the Senate, the resolution passed unanimously. Senate Majority Whip Ann Millner, R-Ogden, condemned Cline for what she did and said they need to stand against bullying.""No child should be bullied especially by adults let alone by an elected official in a position of trust. Not only was this girl targeted, but her family, her basketball team and her entire school,"" she told her Senate colleagues.Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, said her caucus would support the resolution. However, she warned her colleagues that if Cline posted anything similar in the future she would not hesitate to seek impeachment.""We are glad we could come together on this and stand united in censuring an individual that has a lengthy history of hateful and discriminatory rhetoric including homophobic, transphobic and racist comments,"" Sen. Escamilla said.Cline has declined to comment to FOX 13 News on the post and the outrage over it, pointing instead to another Facebook post where she apologized for negative attention her post drew to ""innocent students and their families.""""When legislation is created targeting the transgender community, people will try to judge bodies to assume who’s in that community,"" said Sue Robbins with Equality Utah.“This year, we passed a bill that is wrapped around bathrooms and other privacy spaces, and we will see people try to be the enforcer and judge other people's bodies to determine whether they belong in a space or not,” she said. “We've warned the legislature about this before they pass the bill.”Natalie Cline’s social media post is grounds for impeachment, said Jeff Merchant, Executive Director of the Alliance for a Better Utah.“This is a situation where we had a member of the state School Board engage in cyberbullying against a student, and the legislature decided to slap her on the wrist,” he said.Al Van Der Beek, the father of the student who was targeted by Cline, sent the following statement to FOX 13 News:“It’s not the resolution we were hoping for, but it’s a step in the right direction. We’ll wait and see if Ms. Cline follows through with what her peers on state board, the governor, members of the legislation and thousands of parents recommend she does and resigns. It might send a bigger message if the people of Utah have had their eyes opened a little more as a result of this and don’t re-elect her. Our state and our children deserve to be represented by people we can trust and that don’t undermine and bully our children.”Utah political leaders have repeatedly called for Cline to resign. House Speaker Mike Schultz said he and other members of House GOP leadership met with Cline last week, whom he said has ""dug in"" and refused to resign from office.""I was really disappointed with Natalie's comments,"" the Speaker told reporters of the meeting. ""I think Natalie, unfortunately, feels like she's the victim in this and it's sad.""Speaker Schultz said he also has been speaking with the family of the girl targeted in the social media posts, and he wanted to do what is best for her and her family. Asked by FOX 13 News why he didn't pursue impeachment, Speaker Schultz candidly said the House did not have the two-thirds majority to proceed.He also suggested impeachment would become a national media circus and he didn't want Cline to have the platform.""I don’t think that’s what’s best for the girl, for the family or honestly, I don’t think it’s right to give Natalie Cline a national platform to speak from,"" he said. ""And that would do that. In a couple short months, the voters will hold her accountable at the ballot box.""On Wednesday night, the Utah State Board of Education met and voted unanimously to strip Cline of her duties and censure her. Cline refused to attend the meeting.Under Utah law, the board cannot remove her from office. The House of Representatives in the Utah State Legislature could impeach her from office.At his monthly news conference on Thursday, Governor Spencer Cox said he supported impeachment of Cline in the House of Representatives, but said the state school board's actions did ""effectively impeach"" her.""Whether or not she's impeached probably is immaterial at this point because that's in effect what happened. She's not participating in meetings, she's not able to participate on committees, she doesn't have authority to put agenda items on,"" the governor said. ""That's effectively what has happened.""But absent impeachment, there is a chance that Cline can be re-elected. As FOX 13 News reported last week, Gov. Cox and Lt. Governor Deidre Henderson both personally donated to the campaign of Amanda Bollinger, who is challenging Cline for the Republican nomination for school board.The governor acknowledged the possibility that voters could send Cline back to the state school board for another term. In other states, he pointed out, the state school board is appointed by the governor.The American Civil Liberties of Utah blasted state political leaders for creating a climate that allowed the Cline situation to happen thanks to a series of bills over the years targeting transgender people.""And despite warnings of the consequences from kids, parents, teachers, medical professionals, and advocacy groups, we are seeing tragic and embarrassing results where adults are targeting children. We can’t be surprised when policy violence leads to community violence and leadership violence,"" the group said in a statement, later adding:""Until state officials repudiate these laws, we will all suffer the legal and social consequences they have created. It doesn’t have to be this way. We call on Utah’s lawmakers to repeal all laws attacking the rights of LGBTQ+ people in Utah that have created an environment of dehumanization, exclusion, and bullying.""

Cox predicts a Donald Trump win in November Publicly Schooled By Benjamin Wood @BjaminWood Tweet Pin It Email Print Favorite Saving… Utah Board of Education State school board member Natalie Cline was denounced and censured by the Utah Legislature on Thursday. UNIVERSITY—Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Thursday that the question of whether to impeach controversial state school board member Natalie Cline is effectively moot after Cline's board colleagues voted to take disciplinary action against her on Wednesday. In a unanimous decision, the Utah Board of Education adopted a resolution censuring Cline and formally seeking her resignation, stripping her of board committee assignments and her power to place items on the board agenda, and prohibiting her from attending advisory meetings. The vote followed a week of widespread condemnation against Cline, with lawmakers, local district school boards, city councils and advocacy groups calling for her resignation and/or removal after Cline falsely insinuated on social media that a high school athlete was transgender, posting the student's image and identifying information and generating a torrent of hateful and dangerous rhetoric from Cline's followers. Speaking to reporters at his monthly televised press conference at PBS Utah, Cox said he supported the school board's action, adding that it has the practical effect of ending Cline's power and influence over public education. ""What I think should be done is I think she should resign. That’s the right thing to do—that’s the best thing to do,"" Cox said. ""Whether or not she’s impeached probably is immaterial at this point. That is, in effect, what has happened."" click to enlarge Laura Seitz | Pool Photo Gov. Spencer Cox takes questions at his monthly televised press conference on Thursday, Feb. 15, 2024 By Thursday afternoon, both chambers of the Utah Legislature voted to approve a resolution censuring Cline, denouncing and condemning her ""repugnant"" behavior in the ""strongest possible terms."" Sandy Republican Rep. Robert Spendlove, the resolution's House sponsor, said that lawmakers were in ""uncharted territory"" with no comparable examples in state history. But Cline, he said, had violated the public trust. ""The actions of Miss Cline are so outrageous, so abhorrent and so reprehensible that we must act,"" Spendlove said. While the Senate was unanimous in its vote for the censure, two House members opposed the resolution: Rep. Brett Garner, D-West Valley, and Rep. Phil Lyman, R-Blanding. Garner released a statement suggesting that, without the launch of impeachment proceedings, the resolution did not go far enough in response to Cline's actions. Alternately, Lyman said that condemnation is a strong action for lawmakers to take. ""Natalie Cline’s social media activity, in my observation, did not warrant legislative involvement,"" Lyman said. ""I have also observed the actions of some who may have political motives."" On impeachment, Spendlove said the state is better served by acting quickly to condemn Cline and that an effort to remove Cline from office would likely feed into her hunger for notoriety. ""These people crave attention and they will do anything to get this attention, even resorting to outrageous and abhorrent behavior,"" Spendlove said. Cline issued a muddled apology after deleting the initial post that incited the backlash but has otherwise defended herself and her actions in subsequent statements. Prior to the school board's vote to censure her, Cline accused her colleagues and other critics of engaging in ""election interference"" as she is up for election against challengers who are broadly expected to defeat her if she attempts to weather the current controversy and remain in the race. ""Hardened criminals get better due process than I am being provided,"" Cline wrote on Facebook. ""Is a decision by the [School] Board legitimate if you don't provide the accused with proper due process rights? "" Asked about Cline's claims on Thursday, Cox was dismissive of the insinuations, noting that the otherwise ideologically-divided school board was united in its disdain for Cline's behavior. He also dismissed the idea that he and lawmakers were complicit in creating an environment of gender vigilantism by their passing and his signing of anti-transgender legislation restricting a person from participating in sports, accessing health care and, new this year, using gender-designated restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identify. ""We are all personally responsible for our actions. Natalie Cline is an adult, this is not the first time that she has done things like this,"" Cox said. ""Even if this young person was transgender, it would still have been inappropriate. That is not who we are or what we should be doing ... I think you see that with the backlash—the backlash has been profound, it's been unanimous."" Cox also spent a considerable amount of Thursday's press conference talking about the immigration crisis at the southern U.S. border and its potential impact on November's presidential election. Cox suggested that President Joe Biden's poor handling of the crisis would cost him the election and lead to a second term for former President Donald Trump. An occasional critic of Trump, by Republican standards, Cox said he would not be voting for the former president and would prefer to see Nikki Haley win the Republican nomination, but was nonetheless prepared to work with whomever occupies the White House in January. ""I would love to see Haley nominated and win but I think it’s pretty clear that's not going to happen,"" Cox said. ""I don’t hate people that support Donald Trump. I know why they do that and I think we would be better off asking that question."" Cox was critical of both Biden and Trump's advanced age, suggesting that U.S. presidents should not be octogenarians. He said if either of the major parties abandoned their frontrunner and nominated another, younger candidate, that party would likely win in November by ""historic"" margins. ""I think we’re making a huge mistake as Americans, we should be nominating different people,"" Cox said. ""I think people support president Biden because he’s not Donald Trump. When you put another candidate like Nikki Haley on the ballot, people don’t support president Biden."" click to enlarge Larry H. Miller Company A rendering of The Power District and a new Major League Baseball stadium along the Jordan River, planned for development on Salt Lake City's west side. On other topics, Cox continued to express optimism that Utah will launch Major League Baseball and National Hockey League teams in the coming years. Just before his press conference, the Larry H. Miller Company released new renderings for their proposed baseball stadium on the west side of Salt Lake City and announced a $3.5 billion investment into development of the so-called Power District on North Temple. “We are passionate about this once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in our capital city,” Miller Company CEO Steve Starks said in a prepared statement. “This project will serve as a vibrant extension of and gateway to downtown Salt Lake, complements the mission of the State Fairpark, and brings the Jordan River to life. The Power District will be a gathering place for Utah’s families to live, work, play and enjoy the best views in Major League Baseball.” Cox reiterated that while he's opposed to ""writing out a check to billionaires"" to build sporting facilities, he supports and anticipates tax increment financing and other incentives being made available to shape and facilitate investment in the area, which was long neglected by both the state and city. ""This is kind of an outside indication that everything we’ve been working on for the past decade is working and Utah’s arrow is pointing up,"" Cox said. Cox also commented on the litigation filed by opponents of the new Utah State Flag, seeking to overcome their deficits in a signature-gathering campaign that attempted to place adoption of the new design on the ballot for a public vote. ""I think it’s a tremendous waste of resources,"" Cox said. ""I’m confident that—like everything else they’ve tried so far—will fail as well.""

(AP) — The Alabama Senate voted Wednesday to put a politically appointed board in control of the Alabama Department of Archives and History, a change proposed after some lawmakers were upset about the department hosting a lecture on LGBTQ+ history.State senators also approved legislation that would allow local government officials to dismiss library board members they appointed if they become displeased with their performance. Both bills now move to the Alabama House of Representatives. The Archives’ monthly lunchtime lecture series last year included a June presentation titled “Invisible No More: Alabama’s LGBTQ+ History.” The lecture discussed topics ranging from the state’s first Pride march to the contributions of gay Alabamians. Sen. Chris Elliott, the sponsor of the bills approved Wednesday, said a dozen lawmakers called the Archives urging them to cancel the lecture but the department went forward with it.

He said the change would ensure board members are responsive to elected officials. “I’m making sure that there is some accountability,” Elliott said. Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton told Elliott that his bill appeared to be retribution because department officials didn’t change course when “big bad senator” called. “I let history be history,” Singleton said. The board currently has two members from each congressional district, two at-large members, and the governor. Board members are selected by a vote of the trustees and confirmed by the Alabama Senate.

Under the legislation, the board would be appointed by the governor, lieutenant governor and legislative leaders. The bill dealing with the Archives was approved on a 25-8 vote. The bill related to local libraries is being debated as conservative groups in several states have tried to remove or restrict access to children’s books with LGBTQ content. Elliott said existing state law gives city councils the ability to appoint library board members but currently gives no mechanism for removal. The bill was approved on a 26-7 vote.

Log in here » MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — The Alabama Senate voted Wednesday to put a politically appointed board in control of the Alabama Department of Archives and History, a change proposed after some lawmakers were upset about the department hosting a lecture on LGBTQ+ history. State senators also approved legislation that would allow local government officials to dismiss library board members they appointed if they become displeased with their performance. Both bills now move to the Alabama House of Representatives. The Archives’ monthly lunchtime lecture series last year included a June presentation titled “Invisible No More: Alabama’s LGBTQ+ History.” The lecture discussed topics ranging from the state’s first Pride march to the contributions of gay Alabamians. Sen. Chris Elliott, the sponsor of the bills approved Wednesday, said a dozen lawmakers called the Archives urging them to cancel the lecture but the department went forward with it. “This isn’t history. This is indoctrination,” Elliott said during debate. He said the change would ensure board members are responsive to elected officials. “I’m making sure that there is some accountability,” Elliott said. Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton told Elliott that his bill appeared to be retribution because department officials didn’t change course when “big bad senator” called. “I let history be history,” Singleton said. The board currently has two members from each congressional district, two at-large members, and the governor. Board members are selected by a vote of the trustees and confirmed by the Alabama Senate. Current board members include famed civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, who is perhaps best known for representing Rosa Parks after she refused to give up her seat on a segregated Montgomery city bus in 1955. Under the legislation, the board would be appointed by the governor, lieutenant governor and legislative leaders. The bill dealing with the Archives was approved on a 25-8 vote. The bill related to local libraries is being debated as conservative groups in several states have tried to remove or restrict access to children’s books with LGBTQ content. Elliott said existing state law gives city councils the ability to appoint library board members but currently gives no mechanism for removal. The bill was approved on a 26-7 vote.

The study focused on female patients who received a mastectomy under the Kaiser Permanente Northern California healthcare system by measuring the patient’s “gender-affirming mastectomy incidence, as well as postoperative complications, including regret.” The patients who received a mastectomy ranged from 12 to 17 years old, with over 30 of them between the ages of 12 and 14. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Gender Doctor Says Parents Who Oppose Transitioning Their Kid Have ‘Mental Illness’)Moreover, at least two patients were 12 years old, and six patients were 13 years old, at the time of referral. The number of transgender patients who had mastectomies in the next age category, from 14 to 15 years old, jumped to over 50, while at least 60 of the patients were between the ages of 16 and 17, according to the study. Under Kaiser’s care guidelines, doctors could refer minor patients for a mastectomy even if they hadn’t been on hormones or lived in the “desired gender role” for a full year. “Clinicians at KPNC provide care in accordance with the WPATH guidelines, which state that gender-affirming mastectomy may be advised for patients <18 years preferably after living in the desired gender role for at least one year without hormone therapy as an absolute requirement,” the study reads. “Adolescents with gender dysphoria can be referred to the KPNC Multi-specialty Transitions (MST) Department by their pediatrician, endocrinologist, therapist, parents, or self if ≥ 13 years of age.” In a Northern California health system, 209 preteen or teen girls underwent double mastectomy as gender-affirming care between 2013 and 2020. 15% of these girls were 12- or 13-years old. That’s 32 girls who were 12- or 13 years old when they had their breasts removed. pic.twitter.com/o9YbDw5lsx — Kevin Bass PhD MS (@kevinnbass) February 14, 2024 The researchers lamented “barriers” to transgender medical procedures in certain states and said that they hoped to confirm their belief that regret and complications post-surgery were low. The study found that the demand for transgender mastectomies increased by 13-fold over the seven years and that 7.3% had complications post surgery and 10.9% went back for a revision, “any subsequent procedure that involves the insertion, removal, and/or replacement of a prosthesis or implant.” Of the 209 patients, only 137 had a follow-up of at least one year for the “evaluation of complications and revisions” and were included in the total. Out of that subset, the researchers determined that 10 patients had a total of 15 complications including “hematoma, wound infection, seroma, hypertrophic scar requiring steroid injection, or suture granuloma.” The study also stated that 127 of the patients said they were satisfied with the procedure, while only two of the patients, who were both 16 at the time, expressed regret, with eight left undocumented. The researchers noted that one of the two patients with regrets was in an “un-affirming and unsupportive home and social environment.” An August 2023 study found that increases in sex-change procedures for minors had skyrocketed from 2016 to 2019. Teens aged 12 to 18 made up 3,678 of the overall patients, with 3,215 getting breast or chest reconstruction and 405 patients undergoing genital surgery.Kaiser Permanente did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The GOP has supermajorities in both chambers. One Democratic lawmaker, predicting a legal challenge, said the final arbiters could be the courts.Debates revolving around initiatives on diversity, equity and inclusion — known as DEI — are playing out in statehouses across the country. So far this year, GOP lawmakers have proposed about 50 bills in 20 states that would restrict DEI initiatives or require their public disclosure, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural. Meanwhile, Democrats have filed about two dozen bills in 11 states that would require or promote DEI initiatives. In Kentucky, opponents warned the proposed restrictions on campuses could roll back gains in minority enrollments and stifle campus discussions on topics dealing with past discrimination. READ MORE Republicans work to recruit female and minority candidates even as they criticize diversity programs Republican lawmakers are backing dozens of bills targeting diversity efforts on campus and elsewhere Kentucky Senate committee advances bill limiting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives The legislation, among other things, would bar public colleges and universities from providing preferential treatment based on a person’s political ideology. It would prohibit the schools from requiring people to state specific ideologies or beliefs when seeking admission, employment or promotions. Republican Sen. Mike Wilson said he filed the bill to counter a broader trend in higher education toward denying campus jobs or promotions to faculty refusing to espouse “liberal ideologies fashionable in our public universities.” He said such practices have extended to students and staff as well.“Diversity of thought should be welcomed in our universities and higher education,” Wilson said. “But we’ve seen a trend across the United States of forcing faculty, in order to remain employed, to formally endorse a set of beliefs that may be contrary to their own, all in violation of the First Amendment.”Democratic Sen. Reginald Thomas said the proposed restrictions would jeopardize successes in expanding the number of minority students on Kentucky’s university campuses. “The richness of our diversity and our differences, that’s what makes us strong,” said Thomas, who is Black. “We are like a quilt here in America.”Wilson responded that there’s nothing in the bill to prohibit colleges from supporting diversity initiatives, as long as those efforts don’t include “discriminatory concepts.” The legislation sets out a host of such concepts that would be prohibited, among them that a person, based on their race or gender, bears responsibility for past actions committed by other members of the same race or gender. Another is meant to keep people from feeling guilt or discomfort solely because of their race or gender.The state attorney general’s office would be allowed to take legal action to compel a school’s compliance.Other senators opposing the bill warned that its restrictions could have a chilling effect on what’s taught on college campuses. They pointed to the women’s suffrage movement and the landmark Supreme Court ruling that outlawed segregation of public schools as possible examples of topics that could be excluded. In supporting the bill, GOP Sen. Phillip Wheeler said it’s important for students to delve into the past and learn about the struggles of people. The bill attempts to “get to a balance, to where we’re no longer looked at as the oppressors and the oppressees, that we are each judged on our own merit,” he said.“I think that some of the vitriol that occurs on the campuses, some of the topics, have really done more to divide us than unite us,” he added.The Supreme Court’s June decision ending affirmative action at universities has created a new legal landscape around diversity programs in the workplace and civil society.On Tuesday, one of the most emotional moments of the Kentucky Senate debate came when Republican Sen. Donald Douglas talked about his own life experiences, recalling that some classmates believed he got into medical school because he was a Black athlete, despite his academic achievements. “You know how embarrassed I was?” Douglas said in supporting the bill. “How embarrassed I was to tell them I had an academic scholarship to medical school and I had to explain, as a Black man, how I got a scholarship to medical school?” The changes proposed in the bill would be painful for some people, Douglas acknowledged. But he predicted that most affected students will “succeed with vigor and they will succeed with a sense that they are responsible for their success and not just the system.”___The legislation is Senate Bill 6.

On Tuesday, one of the most emotional moments of the Kentucky Senate debate came when Republican Sen. Donald Douglas talked about his own life experiences, recalling that some classmates believed he got into medical school because he was a Black athlete, despite his academic achievements. “You know how embarrassed I was?"" Douglas said in supporting the bill. “How embarrassed I was to tell them I had an academic scholarship to medical school and I had to explain, as a Black man, how I got a scholarship to medical school?” The changes proposed in the bill would be painful for some people, Douglas acknowledged. But he predicted that most affected students will “succeed with vigor and they will succeed with a sense that they are responsible for their success and not just the system.” Related Stories Bill prohibiting DEI in college admissions, hiring advances Senate committee Senate Bill 6 targets diversity, equity, and inclusion at Kentucky universities Spectrum News CONTACT CAREERS ABOUT RSS FAQ SITEMAP ADVERTISE WITH US TERMS Your Privacy Rights California Consumer Privacy Rights California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising Spectrum News App © 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.

Health | ACLU sues Children’s Hospital Colorado for halting adult gender-affirming surgeries Lawsuit alleges hospital is discriminating based on gender identity Children’s Hospital Colorado on the Anschutz Medical Campus located at 13123 East 16th Avenue in Aurora on Wednesday, June 9, 2021. (Photo by Eric Lutzens/The Denver Post) By Meg Wingerter | mwingerter@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: February 14, 2024 at 11:57 a.m. | UPDATED: February 15, 2024 at 8:28 a.m.The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday that Children’s Hospital Colorado is discriminating against transgender patients by refusing to perform surgeries it offers to cisgender patients with other conditions. The lawsuit, filed in Denver District Court, also states the hospital is discriminating on the basis of disability because gender dysphoria — distress when a person’s sense of their gender doesn’t align with physical characteristics — is a medical condition. The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of an 18-year-old Denver patient who was on track to receive chest reconstruction surgery before the Aurora hospital discontinued gender-affirming surgeries for adults last year. Representatives of Children’s Hospital Colorado said they couldn’t comment Wednesday because the hospital hadn’t yet been served with the lawsuit. The main reason young cisgender men seek chest reconstruction surgery is if they developed feminine-appearing breasts because of hormonal imbalances or medication side effects, according to the lawsuit. The hospital also sometimes performs breast reduction surgery on young women who have excessive chest tissue that causes pain, the lawsuit said. The patient, who is identified in the lawsuit by the pseudonym Caden Kent, started receiving care at Children’s for mental health concerns when he was 16. He was diagnosed with gender dysphoria a few months later and had undergone about eight months of assessment before determining he was a candidate for surgery once he turned 18. In July, the hospital announced it would no longer offer chest reconstruction surgery for transgender patients, though they could still receive other gender-affirming treatment, including counseling, puberty blockers and hormone therapy. The hospital had only offered surgery to patients who were at least 18. At the time, the hospital stated it had received an unusual number of referrals for gender-affirming surgery as programs shut down in other states, and that it didn’t shut down the program because of threats. It came at a time when children’s hospitals were scrubbing references to transgender care from their websites, though, with at least 21 removing information in 2022. According to the lawsuit, Kent chose to undergo surgery at Children’s because he received other care there, and hoped to recover from the surgery before leaving for college in the fall. Other surgical providers who accept his family’s insurance were booked up, meaning his parents will have to pay out-of-pocket for him to undergo the surgery in that time frame. Kent had resorted to chest-binding to ease his dysphoria, but found himself withdrawing from others when binding became too painful and he couldn’t otherwise hide the breast tissue, the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of 18-year-old Caden Kent, which is a pseudonym, says Kent began receiving care at Children's Hospital Colorado's TRUE Center for Gender Diversity in 2021 when he was 16 years old. Kent was struggling with gender dysphoria that prevented him from ""living a full life,"" the lawsuit claims. In December 2022, Kent began discussing chest masculinization surgery with his doctors and care team at Children's Hospital Colorado, the lawsuit says. The surgery typically consists of subcutaneous mastectomy that is followed by reconstruction of the chest. The ACLU's filing says the surgery is regularly performed on transgender men who have a higher risk of developing cancer. Kent and his family chose a plastic surgeon associated with Children's Hospital Colorado. The family was told that before surgery, they needed to receive letters of support from an endocrinologist and a mental health professional, as well as insurance preauthorization, the lawsuit says. In May and in June of 2023, Kent received the needed letters of support. On July 13, Kent's insurance authorization came in the mail. The next day, Kent's father sent a message through the patient portal to the surgeon's physician's assistant to schedule the surgery, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit claims Children's Hospital Colorado determined it would no longer provide medically necessary surgeries to transgender patients for treatment of gender dysphoria beginning on or about July 13. ""You’re on the cusp of living as your true, authentic self and to have that ripped out from under you is a truly devastating thing,"" ACLU legal director Tim Macdonald said. ""We’ve talked to lots of people in the community that provide support to the trans community and there has been a lot of outcry for this about why the hospital chose to make this decision and to try and persuade them to go back to treating people fairly and consistent with the law."" The ACLU's suit says Children's Hospital Colorado still offers the same procedures to patients, including non-pediatric patients, to treat conditions other than gender dysphoria, which violates the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act ""on the basis of his sex, gender identity, gender expression, and disability."" Kent and his attorneys requested: An injunction and order that would require Children's Hospital Colorado comply with CADAA fine of $3,500 or actual monetary damagesThree fines for violating CADA, totaling $1,500 ""You’ve taken one of the providers doing these life-affirming, life-saving treatments and taken them away, that just increases the burden on the remaining entities that will do that and you have people who are in desperate position who really needs these surgeries, they’re going to have to wait longer and try to find other places that will do the surgeries,"" Macdonald shared, on behalf of his client. Children's Hospital Colorado said they did not immediately have a statement because they had not yet been served with the lawsuit. To this, Macdonald said the lawsuit should not have come as a surprise. ""Before we filed the lawsuit, we sent them a letter saying we thought this was a violation of anti-discrimination laws, so this is not something that came out of the blue,"" Macdonald said. The letter to Children's was sent via email on July 31, 2023, shortly after the hospital moved to ban the surgical practices. ""We’re pressing our shoulder against the wheel and we’re going to try to make sure that the wheels of justice turn as quickly as they can so that Children’s will start providing the care that we believe the hospital is lawfully obligated to provide and were providing up until July,"" Macdonald said.

Local News Transgender patient sues Children’s Hospital Colorado after surgery denied by: Heather Willard Posted: Feb 14, 2024 / 07:01 PM MST Updated: Feb 14, 2024 / 07:49 PM MST ACLU: Hospital discriminated when it stopped gender-affirming surgeries by: Heather Willard Posted: Feb 14, 2024 / 07:01 PM MST Updated: Feb 14, 2024 / 07:49 PM MST SHARE DENVER (KDVR) — The ACLU of Colorado says it is suing Children’s Hospital Colorado on behalf of an 18-year-old transgender patient who was denied a gender-affirming surgery. The lawsuit claims the hospital violated Colorado’s anti-discrimination laws when it stopped providing gender-affirming surgeries in July 2023. The lawsuit was filed in Denver District Court on Wednesday, according to the document. Denver clerk refuses budget cuts: ‘Would absolutely put our election at risk’ According to the ACLU, the patient, who is using the pseudonym of Caden Kent for this lawsuit, had just received insurance authorization for a procedure at Children’s Hospital when the hospital adopted its new policy and refused to move forward with the surgery. The ACLU said gender-affirming surgical care is medically necessary and sometimes life-saving for transgender people. “CHCO’s abrupt cancellation of all gender-affirming surgeries for its trans patients was devastating to Caden, other impacted patients, and Colorado’s transgender community,” Tim Macdonald, ACLU of Colorado legal director, said in the lawsuit announcement. “Refusal to provide medically necessary care based on the identity of the person seeking it, and the condition for which they are seeking it, is discriminatory and illegal under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act.” According to the hospital, it has not been served with any litigation from the ACLU of Colorado. Children’s Hospital Colorado stops gender-affirming surgeries On July 19, 2023, a Children’s Hospital Colorado spokesperson told FOX31 the hospital had been receiving “unprecedented referrals for gender-affirming care,” and to maintain a certain level of care for pediatric patients, they were discontinuing surgical gender-affirming procedures for patients over 18 years old. “Our team is now working with impacted adult patients to explore referrals to the many other hospitals in the region that provide this care for adults,” the hospital statement said in July 2023. “We have not performed gender-affirming surgeries for patients under 18 years of age.” In the lawsuit text, the ACLU argues that Kent was told by Children’s Hospital Colorado doctors in May 2023 that he was a good candidate for chest masculinization surgery and received a letter of support from his primary care doctor. Kent had previously explained his struggles with gender identity and expression to his doctors and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in early 2022, according to the lawsuit. On June 2, 2023, a surgical physician’s assistant at Children’s Hospital Colorado confirmed that the hospital had received the required letters and submitted the request for insurance pre-authorization, the lawsuit says. Minnesota woman accused of sexually assaulting Colorado youth hockey players That insurance authorization was received by Kent’s family on July 13, 2023 — the same day the hospital changed its policy, according to the complaint. A day later, Kent’s father messaged the physician assistant to report the authorization, according to the complaint. The physician’s assistant received the preauthorization and immediately called the family to explain the new policy and said they could not schedule the procedure. According to the complaint, the physician’s assistant said although Kent was an established patient in the practice, the practice’s pediatric surgeons were now prohibited from completing his surgery. “The physician’s assistant expressed regret that they ‘unfortunately ha[d] not been given any further information to answer critical questions regarding any reasoning behind this executive decision,'” the complaint stated. Discrimination claimed in hospital’s gender-affirming surgery policy After 20 months of treatment for gender dysphoria and eight months of consultation for top surgery, the news of his denial “crushed” Kent and his family, the complaint stated. The lawsuit is seeking: An order finding that Children’s Hospital Colorado discriminated against Kent based on his sex, gender identity, gender expression and disability An injunction and order requiring CHCO’s compliance with the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act A $3,500 award based on disability discrimination A $500 award based on gender identity A $500 award based on sex A $500 award based on gender expression FOX31 Weather: View the latest Denver forecasts, maps and radar According to the complaint, Kent and his family have “made every effort” to establish care with another provider to get surgery, re-establish insurance authorization, and schedule it at a time Kent could recover at home before leaving for college. Kent’s family was unable to do this and will now have to pay for the surgery out of pocket to complete post-operation recovery before leaving for college this fall, the lawsuit stated.

This includes directly interviewing sources and analyzing primary source documents. An 18-year-old transgender patient whose surgery was called off when Children’s Hospital Colorado stopped providing gender-affirming surgeries is suing the hospital. The ACLU of Colorado filed the lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of the 18-year-old, claiming the hospital violated state anti-discrimination laws. Children’s Hospital said in July that it was no longer providing transgender surgeries, noting unprecedented referrals as well as threats to hospitals across the country. The hospital did not provide surgeries to minors and stopped offering them for those 18 and older over the summer, resulting in cancellations for an unknown number of patients who had scheduled procedures such as chest reconstruction. The American Civil Liberties Union said the hospital stopped providing “medically necessary surgeries” to transgender patients “without warning, notice, or plans for ensuring continuity of care.” The 18-year-old plaintiff, who uses the pseudonym Caden Kent in the lawsuit to protect his privacy, had just received insurance authorization for a chest masculinization surgery procedure at Children’s, the final step before receiving a surgery date, the lawsuit says. The surgery was planned after about two years of treatment for gender dysphoria, which the teen began receiving at age 16. He was a patient of Children’s TRUE Center for Gender Diversity and began hormone treatment in March 2022. ☀️ READ MORE Body of deceased woman, 30 human cremains found at Denver house during ex-funeral home owner’s eviction 12:45 PM MST on Feb 16, 20244:45 PM MST on Feb 16, 2024 Two people found dead after shooting at University of Colorado Colorado Springs dorm 8:59 AM MST on Feb 16, 20242:35 PM MST on Feb 16, 2024 Ski resorts’ long history of immunity threatened by Colorado Supreme Court case 3:50 AM MST on Feb 16, 20245:07 PM MST on Feb 15, 2024 Caden was assigned female at birth, but identifies as male, according to the lawsuit. Gender dysphoria is a mental health condition defined as incongruence between a person’s gender identity and assigned sex at birth. Left untreated, it can lead to depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. The “abrupt cancellation of all gender-affirming surgeries for its trans patients was devastating,” Tim Macdonald, ACLU of Colorado’s legal director, said in a news release. Children’s was one of the few hospitals in Colorado where transgender patients could use insurance to pay for gender-affirming surgery. Caden’s gender dysphoria caused him “severe distress” and “made him retreat from major aspects of his daily life,” including showering and using the restroom, the lawsuit says. “He avoided socializing with other people and speaking, so as not to be misgendered because of his voice,” it says. After his surgery at Children’s was canceled, Caden’s family made plans to pay for the surgery out of pocket at another facility and in time for him to recover before going to college in the fall, the lawsuit said. Children’s Hospital said it had not yet been served with the lawsuit and did not comment. Besides chest masculinization surgery, Children’s had offered hysterectomies to patients 18 and older, according to the lawsuit. About half of states have banned or restricted gender-affirming care, which may or may not include surgery, for children.

Updated: February 16, 2024 @ 7:05 pm Full Forecast Friday, February 16, 2024 E-Paper Newsletter Facebook Instagram ACLU sues Children’s Hospital Colorado for halting adult gender-affirming surgeries By Meg Wingerter The Denver Post (TNS) Feb 14, 2024 Feb 14, 2024 denver — The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado alleges Children’s Hospital Colorado is discriminating against transgender patients by refusing to perform surgeries it offers to cisgender patients with other conditions.The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Denver District Court, also states the hospital is discriminating on the basis of disability, because gender dysphoria — distress when a person’s sense of their gender doesn’t align with physical characteristics — is a medical condition.The ACLU filed it on behalf of an 18-year-old Denver patient who was on track to receive gender-affirming surgery before the hospital discontinued that service. The main reason young cisgender men seek chest reconstruction is if they developed feminine-appearing breasts because of hormonal imbalances or medication side effects, according to the lawsuit. The hospital also sometimes performs breast reduction surgery on young women who have excessive chest tissue that causes pain, it said.The patient, who is identified in the lawsuit by the pseudonym Caden Kent, started receiving care at Children’s for mental health concerns when he was 16. He was diagnosed with gender dysphoria a few months later and had undergone about eight months of assessment before determining he was a candidate for surgery once he turned 18. In July, the hospital announced it would no longer offer chest reconstruction surgery for transgender patients, though they could still receive other gender-affirming treatment, including counseling, puberty blockers and hormone therapy. The hospital had only offered surgery to patients who were at least 18.The hospital stated it had received an unusual number of referrals for gender-affirming surgery as programs shut down in other states, and that it didn’t shut down the program because of threats. It came at a time when children’s hospitals were scrubbing references to transgender care from their websites, though, with at least 21 removing information in 2022. A search on the hospital’s website for its TRUE Center for Gender Diversity no longer turns up any results.According to the lawsuit, Kent chose to undergo surgery at Children’s because he received other care there, and hoped to recover from the surgery before leaving for college in the fall. Other surgical providers who accept his family’s insurance are booked up, meaning his parents will have to pay out-of-pocket for him to undergo the surgery in that time frame. Kent had resorted to chest-binding to ease his dysphoria, but found himself withdrawing from others when binding became too painful and he couldn’t otherwise hide the breast tissue, it said.“(Children’s Hospital Colorado’s) abrupt cancellation of all gender-affirming surgeries for its trans patients was devastating to Caden, other impacted patients, and Colorado’s transgender community,” ACLU of Colorado legal director Tim Macdonald said in a news release. “Refusal to provide medically necessary care based on the identity of the person seeking it, and the condition for which they are seeking it, is discriminatory and illegal under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act.” © 2024 MediaNews Group, Inc.

The victim, 18, was attending a roller-skating party with friends when she was allegedly attacked by a group and subjected to slurs, it is said.Summer Betts-Ramsey, 19, appeared in the dock at Willesden magistrates court on Tuesday, accused of being involved in the stabbing. She has been charged with attempted murder and possession of an offensive weapon in public. Prosecutor Bunsri Bhuwa confirmed to the court that “the victim is a transgender female.”The stabbing happened in Masons Avenue in Wealdstone, northwest London at roughly 7pm on Saturday. The court heard the victim had arranged to attend a rollerskating party with friends at Harrow Leisure Centre that day. It is said she sustained 14 stab wounds in the alleged attack and was rushed to hospital for treatment. Betts-Ramsey wept in the dock as she confirmed her name, date of birth, and her address in Cricklewood, northwest London. She did not formally enter any pleas after the charges were read out to her.Wearing prison-issue grey clothes and with her hair tied up into a ponytail, the teenager was flanked by two guards during the 30-minute hearing. She was remanded into custody until a plea hearing at the Old Bailey on March 12. After being told she faces the next month in custody, Betts-Ramsey tearfully asked to speak to her mother through the glass front of the dock. Afterwards, she called out “I love you” when she was led away to the cells. The court was told Betts-Ramsey denies being involved in the stabbing. The Metropolitan Police has said the victim of the alleged attack has now been discharged from hospital and is being supported by her family.

Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/ShutterstockCanadaCanadian conservatives divided over trans policy Alberta premier’s moves to ban trans treatments rejected by fellow rightwing leader in OntarioLeyland CeccoWed 14 Feb 2024 08.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Feb 2024 10.13 ESTAt the end of January, Danielle Smith, the premier of Alberta, announced a list of policy changes targeting transgender youth in the Canadian province, including a ban on hormonal treatment, puberty blockers and gender-confirmation surgery for children 15 years old and younger. The move marked the most restrictive rules on gender confirmation in the country.A few days later, Doug Ford – the Conservative premier of Ontario, and one of the most influential politicians in Canada – was asked whether his government intended to follow Smith’s policies. “No,” he told reporters. “We have a lot here, and we’re leaving everything alone.”Canada province uses constitutional override to advance pronoun legislationRead moreThe two conservative leaders’ contrasting views on care for transgender youth highlight the limits of a culture war apparently imported to Canada from the United States. The issue, which affects only a slim minority of youth across the country, has nonetheless sharply divided political leaders within the conservative movement, with some believing it is a losing political issue that puts them on the wrong side of public opinion.In a video posted to social media on 31 January, Smith announced a string of what she described as policy changes. She said top and bottom gender-confirmation surgeries would be banned for minors under age 17, although bottom surgery is already limited to adults. While top surgery is permitted in Alberta, reporting also suggests only eight youth received surgery for gender confirmation last year.Under the new proposal, hormone therapy will only be available to teens aged 16 and older, with permission from their parents, a physician and a psychologist, instead of at the onset of puberty. Parents will need to give permission before students 15 and under can use a name or pronoun at school other than the one given at birth, Smith said. Students will need to opt in to classes dealing with sexuality and gender, reversing previous policy under which parents could have their children opt out of sexual education classes. Transgender women would be banned from women’s sports.In the days after the announcement, Smith told the media the changes were motivated by a “concern of what will happen”, rather than any current issues facing her government.Smith’s announcement prompted widespread criticism, both from the Alberta Medical Association, which called on the premier to “reconsider” the proposed policies and to work with “experienced professionals” and the Canadian Paediatric Society, which warned that the proposals “will lead to significant negative health outcomes, including increased risk of suicide and self-harm”.“It has to be the most hateful piece of legislation that we’ve seen in the LGBTQ community,” said Jen Gilbert, a professor at the University of Toronto. “They seem to want to take a very small number of young people and turn them into political pawns. And not only does it hurt those young people, it sends a signal to all queer and trans kids that their identities are up for debate.”Gilbert, who specializes in sex education, said Smith’s proposed changes mirror the legislative activism of conservatives in the United States and the burgeoning “parental rights movement”.“These activists are networked with each other and they’re sharing techniques, strategies about how to affect policy. This particular set of restrictions is very similar to what we’ve seen proposed in the US,” said Gilbert. “And these policies that claim to be for the rights of parents clearly aren’t: what about LGBTQ parents and the parents of queer and trans kids?”Months before Alberta waded into the issue, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan – both led by conservative premiers – announced changes to pronoun policies in schools, the latter using the notwithstanding clause of Canada’s constitution to block any legal challenges.But as a growing list of conservative politicians court a fixation on gender issues, Doug Ford has bucked the trend.“Of course, we don’t know where he’s going to be six months from now. He’s the king of the flip-flop,” said Susan Gapka, a Toronto-based community organiser and transgender rights activist. “But he also cares a lot about public opinion. And so his recent stance – that he’s not going to get involved in this – has given me a bit of hope. And hope is something we desperately need right now.”Ford has resisted neat political categorisation amid the deep partisanship that has come to define modern Canadian politics.“He’s rightwing, he believes in smaller government. But he’s not as driven ideologically as other leaders in the province,” said Nelson Wiseman, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto. “His background is in business, not politics.”The Ontario premier also has a reputation as a leader willing to quickly retreat on major policy proposals if he senses a shift in public opinion against his government.“The proposals in Alberta would not stand up to court challenges and so Smith would need to invoke the notwithstanding clause to suspend the fundamental rights of trans people if she wants to pass these sorts of policies,” said Gapka. “I suspect Doug Ford sees this – and realizes it’s something he wants to avoid.”Other Ontario conservatives seem baffled by Smith’s decision. One told the Toronto Star it was a “solution in search of a problem”.Wiseman said few people in Ontario – or even in Alberta – list gender confirmation for young people as a major voting concern: “When you ask people in either province what are the issues, nobody mentions this. They talk about inflation, they talk about the environment. And so you’re stupid wading into it.”But Gapka says the Alberta policies have cast a dark cloud over the transgender community and renewed the need for national efforts to help those most affected by the proposed changes.“I think about those young families in rural Alberta and how they must be feeling right now,” she said. “But we’ll fight for them. They can count on that. And we will overcome.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaTransgenderGenderAmericasfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Read our privacy notice Activists and LGBTQ+ community members handed out colorful chocolate candy for Valentine’s Day in Tokyo on Wednesday, marking the fifth anniversary of the launch of a legal battle to achieve marriage equality for same-sex couples.Japan is the only member of the Group of Seven nations that still excludes same-sex couples from the right to legally marry and receive spousal benefits. Support for legalizing marriage equality has grown among the Japanese public, but the governing Liberal Democratic Party, known for its conservative family values and reluctance to promote gender equality and sexual diversity, remains the main opposition to the campaign. Gathered outside of a busy downtown Tokyo train station, activists and LGBTQ+ community members urged for equal marriage rights as they handed out bags of Meiji “marble chocolate” candy — Japan's version of M&Ms — with flyers explaining their lawsuits.Wednesday is also the fifth anniversary of the launch of first lawsuits petitioning for LGBTQ+ marriage rights. Since Feb. 14, 20019, more than a dozen couples have filed lawsuits in six separate cases at five courts across Japan. Four of the five rulings so far have found that not granting the right was unconstitutional, one said it was in line with the constitution while the ruling in the sixth petition, before a district court in Tokyo, is due next month. At Wednesday's rally, 41-year-old former police officer who goes by the name of Kotfe, an alias to protect his identity because of fears for legal ramifications, said he and his male partner hope there will be more public awareness and support for sexual diversity and same sex unions. He and his partner, a former firefighter, have been together for 12 years and plan to consider marriage once they achieve the right.Fumiko Suda, a lawyer representing plaintiffs in Japan's northern city of Sapporo — one of the venues of the six legal case — said she was frustrated over the government's reluctance to legalize marriage equality.Marriage equality is now recognized in 36 countries, not only in the West but also in Asia, including Taiwan, Thailand and Nepal, according to the Marriage for All Japan, a civil group which Suda is a member of.While Japan's conservative government is seen stonewalling diversity, recent surveys show a majority of Japanese back legalizing same-sex marriage. Support among the business community has rapidly increased. Though critics said it was watered down, the government enacted an LGBTQ+ awareness promotion law in June. The Supreme Court separately ruled that Japan's law requiring compulsory sterilization surgery for transgender people to officially change their gender is unconstitutional. “Despite many years I have spent with my partner, we are considered strangers, not family,” in the eyes of the law, said Hiromi Hatogai, a lesbian who is part of the case before the Tokyo district court. “We only want to marry and (be) legally recognized, just like any other couple,” she said.More aboutJapanAPLGBTQ+TokyoSupportJapaneseMarriageSupreme CourtSapporoAsiaNepalThailandTaiwan1/1On Valentine's Day, LGBTQ+ activists in Japan call for the right for same-sex couples to marryOn Valentine's Day, LGBTQ+ activists in Japan call for the right for same-sex couples to marryJapan LGBTQCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Support for legalizing marriage equality has grown among the Japanese public, but the governing Liberal Democratic Party, known for its conservative family values and reluctance to promote gender equality and sexual diversity, remains the main opposition to the campaign. Gathered outside of a busy downtown Tokyo train station, activists and LGBTQ+ community members urged for equal marriage rights as they handed out bags of Meiji “marble chocolate” candy — Japan’s version of M&Ms — with flyers explaining their lawsuits. Wednesday is also the fifth anniversary of the launch of first lawsuits petitioning for LGBTQ+ marriage rights. Since Feb. 14, 20019, more than a dozen couples have filed lawsuits in six separate cases at five courts across Japan. Four of the five rulings so far have found that not granting the right was unconstitutional, one said it was in line with the constitution while the ruling in the sixth petition, before a district court in Tokyo, is due next month. At Wednesday’s rally, 41-year-old former police officer who goes by the name of Kotfe, an alias to protect his identity because of fears for legal ramifications, said he and his male partner hope there will be more public awareness and support for sexual diversity and same sex unions. He and his partner, a former firefighter, have been together for 12 years and plan to consider marriage once they achieve the right.

Support among the business community has rapidly increased. Though critics said it was watered down, the government enacted an LGBTQ+ awareness promotion law in June. The Supreme Court separately ruled that Japan’s law requiring compulsory sterilization surgery for transgender people to officially change their gender is unconstitutional. “Despite many years I have spent with my partner, we are considered strangers, not family,” in the eyes of the law, said Hiromi Hatogai, a lesbian who is part of the case before the Tokyo district court. “We only want to marry and (be) legally recognized, just like any other couple,” she said.

The couple, both senior tech company executives who had returned to Greece after years in London, were in hospital with their daughter.“Niovi was two and sick with bronchitis,” said Kalfaki, who heads the public sector division of Google Cloud in Athens. “Naturally we both wanted to be with her but when the doctors asked ‘Who is the mother?’ and they heard ‘We both are’, their response was ‘That’s legally not possible’ and they refused to let Christina in. There was a terrible scene as she argued and implored but they were adamant. Only I, as Niovi’s birth mother, could be with her.”It was not the pair’s first brush with the law. Months earlier the Greek embassy in London had refused to recognise their daughter’s birth certificate because it bore the names of both Kalfaki and Leimoni.“I was reduced to tears,” said Kalfaki, who at 45 has spent more than a third of her life with Leimoni. “It was traumatic, this feeling that as a same-sex couple you are not just lesser but helpless under the law. It’s then that Christina said we’re going to have to fight to protect our rights.”That fight comes full circle on Thursday when the Greek parliament debates legislation that will, if passed in a subsequent vote, make the country the first in south-east Europe to legalise same-sex marriage.For the LGBTQ+ community, the milestone bill marks the end of a legal void that has left many distraught, even if the bill is also criticised for not going far enough (to the consternation of gay and transgender people it does not amend rules limiting parenthood through surrogacy to single women and straight couples).“Yes, it could be better but the truth is it will also delete so much stress and anxiety from our daily lives,” said Kalfaki, explaining that as the recipients of reciprocal IVF in the UK – a process where one partner carries an embryo formed with the fertilised egg of the other – their daughter was a “truly joint creation”.“Finally we’ll not only be recognised legally as partners in marriage but individually as parents … Previously Christina would have had no access to our daughter if anything had happened to me. Niovi would have been sent to a care home, an institution.”Few reforms in Greece have stirred as much rancour or debate. In the four weeks since announcing his government’s decision to draft the law, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has had to face the ire of the powerful Orthodox church, the concern of many MPs in his centre-right New Democracy party (ND) and the entrenched social conservatism of a populace resistant to change and suspicious of diversity. Populist tabloids have labelled the law “monstrous”.Indicative of the hostility towards the measure, the far-right Spartans party leader, Vassilis Stigas, told parliament that the bill was tantamount to “opening the window” to paedophiles as he urged ND MPs to vote against it, while the bishop of Piraeus claimed that homosexuality was a “mortal sin” and a cause of cancer. “Google it and you will see,” he told stunned interviewers on Skai TV.View image in fullscreenThere were protests in Athens on Sunday against the plans to legalise same-sex marriage. Photograph: Yorgos Karahalis/APOutrage over the reform was on full display on Sunday when thousands of people attended a rally in Athens organised by Orthodox religious groups to deplore the “sodomisation of Greek society” and pray “in support of the family”.With his own lawmakers so divided, Mitsotakis knows passage of the bill will only come with support from centrist and leftist parties – at a time when he has faced fierce criticism from the opposition over a spy scandal and curbs on media freedom. But his aides say that is a price the self-avowed liberal is willing to pay if it means changing mindsets on an issue that has remained so taboo.The leader, whose party includes rightwing nationalists, had made the revamp of family law a key campaign promise before securing a landslide victory and a second four-year term in office last year. Legalising same-sex marriage and allowing adoption rights for same-sex couples was central to the reform.“For him there are no invisible people with fewer rights than others,” said Akis Skertsos, a minister of state who has overseen the law. “Countries which succeed in sustaining a balance between economic prosperity and personal happiness are those that prioritise civil liberties and rule of law.”Skertsos has led the charge to persuade MPs about the measure’s merits, although Mitsotakis says the decision ultimately lies with deputies and he will not enforce party discipline.If, as expected, the bill is passed – with the support of other parties including the main opposition Syriza headed by Stefanos Kasselakis, Greece’s first out gay party leader – the Mediterranean nation will become the 21st in Europe, the 16th in the EU and the 37th country worldwide to legalise same-sex marriage.But the inflammatory rhetoric in the run-up to the vote has left little doubt that more is needed if Greeks – still prone to dismissing the idea that there were gay people in antiquity – are to embrace 21st-century notions of the modern family accepted elsewhere in Europe. Homophobic attacks have soared in recent weeks and gay support hotlines have been overwhelmed with calls.Stefanos Kasselakis: the political outsider hoping to revive the Greek leftRead moreAccusations of discrimination are not new to Greece, one of the last EU members to introduce civil unions for same-sex couples in 2015. Before Mitsotakis appointed the first out gay minister, and agay man, Alexis Patelis, as his chief economic adviser in 2019, gay people – at least those who were out – did not hold high office.In the absence of visibility, the community remained on the margins of society, with the media and church often blatantly homophobic. The first gay pride marches in Athens were deemed so controversial that participants were pelted with eggs – in sharp contrast to today’s celebrations attended by foreign ambassadors and politicians.Few people know this better than the gallerist Rebecca Camhi. Long regarded as the queen of the Greek capital’s contemporary art scene, the 58-year-old has never hidden her sexuality. In a docuseries about prominent Greek women aired on state TV a few years ago, she raised more than a few eyebrows by talking about family life with her partner, Marina Comninos, and her daughter, Anatolia, now a student at Edinburgh University.But on a hot summer’s day last year Camhi went further, ensuring the issue got a hearing in polite society when the couple threw a party to celebrate the civil union they had entered into days earlier.View image in fullscreenRebecca Camhi (left) and Marina Comninos during a party to mark their civil union. Photograph: supplied“A lot of those present, open-minded and civilised as they may be, would not naturally find themselves attending a gay event,” Camhi said of scenes that would go down as unprecedented in the Piraeus yacht club. “And at some point in my speech I made a point of making it a point, shouting out to gay friends who were there in sheer joy because people really have no idea what we all went through back in the day.”She said the bill before the parliament was not only groundbreaking but critical for younger Greeks who might be struggling with their sexual orientation. “It will have a huge ripple effect and give the message especially to young people who may be afraid to come out, to tell their parents for fear of being rejected, that there are others like you out there, you’re not a pariah and you’re not alone. I don’t think members of the Greek parliament are quite aware how important it is.”Until now, same-sex couples have had to go abroad if they want to marry. While civil unions have provided legal protections, practical difficulties have remained so fundamental that many living abroad simply ruled out ever returning.View image in fullscreenKostas Androulakis, husband Michael and their sons. Photograph: supplied“The minute we land in Greece, our two boys lose one of their parents,” said Kostas Androulakis, 46, who is raising his adopted sons in London with his husband, Michael. “Right now, because they aren’t recognised as our kids, they can’t inherit from us, aren’t entitled to free [state] healthcare in Greece or education or becoming Greek citizens.”Androulakis is among those who have flown to Athens to witness the vote that could change his life and the lives of so many others. “It’s going to be a historic day,” said the management consultant, who left Greece back in the 1990s when it was “all doom and gloom for gay people” and such legislation seemed nigh on impossible.Kalfaki could not agree more. “Yes there are shortcomings but you can’t go from zero to 100 in one bill,” she said. “It’s a start, a brilliant, brilliant start, and it’s going to be a very good day.” This article was amended on 15 February. An earlier version said that, if the vote passed, Greece would be the first country in southern Europe to have legalised same-sex marriage; this should have said south-east Europe.Explore more on these topicsGreeceLGBTQ+ rightsEuropenewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The issue has failed to trigger deep divisions in a country more worried about the high cost of living.The landmark Bill drafted by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis ′ centre-right government is backed by four left-wing parties, including the main opposition Syriza.That would secure it a comfortable majority in the 300-seat Parliament. Several majority and left-wing lawmakers are expected to abstain or vote against the reform — but not enough to kill the Bill. Three small far-right parties and the Soviet-inspired Communist Party have rejected the draft law.Supporters and opponents of the Bill have announced plans to hold separate gatherings outside Parliament later Thursday. “People who have been invisible will finally be made visible around us. And with them, many children (will) finally find their rightful place,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told lawmakers ahead of the vote. “Both parents of same-sex couples do not yet have the same legal opportunities to provide their children with what they need,"" he added. ""To be able to pick them up from school, to be able to travel, to go to the doctor, or take them to the hospital. ... That is what we are fixing.” The Bill would confer full parental rights on married same-sex partners with children. But it precludes gay couples from parenthood through surrogate mothers in Greece — an option currently available to women who can't have children for health reasons.Governing New Democracy lawmaker Maria Syrengela said the reform would redress a long-standing injustice for same-sex couples and their children.“And let’s reflect on what these people have been through, spending so many years in the shadows, entangled in bureaucratic procedures,” she said.Polls show that while most Greeks agree to same-sex weddings they also reject extending parenthood through surrogacy to male couples. Same-sex civil partnerships have been allowed in Greece since 2015. But that only conferred legal guardianship to the biological parents of children in those relationships, leaving their partners in a bureaucratic limbo.The main opposition to the new bill has come from the traditionalist Church of Greece — which also disapproves of heterosexual civil marriage.Church officials have centered their criticism on the bill's implications for traditional family values, and argue that potential legal challenges could lead to a future extension of surrogacy rights to gay couples.The head of the Orthodox Church of Greece, Archbishop Ieronymos, suggested Wednesday that the ballot should be held by roll call. This would enable constituents to see exactly how their lawmakers voted.That's going to happen anyway, following motions later in the day by far-right parties and — independently and for different reasons — Syriza. The main opposition leader, Stefanos Kasselakis, who is gay, has threatened disciplinary action against any Syriza lawmaker who doesn't back the bill.Church supporters and conservative organisations have staged small protests against the proposed law, and members of far-right groups have called for a demonstration outside Parliament later Thursday. Politically, the same-sex marriage law is not expected to harm Mr. Mitsotakis' government, which won easy re-election last year after capturing much of the centrist vote.A stronger challenge comes from ongoing protests by farmers angry at high production costs, and intense opposition from many students to the planned scrapping of a state monopoly on university education.Nevertheless, Parliament is expected to approve the university Bill later this month, and opinion polls indicate that most Greeks support it.

But support from opposition parties means it is certain to pass. World NewsAgence France-PresseUpdated: February 15, 2024 3:36 pm ISTChildren do not automatically inherit from their non-biological parents.Athens: Greece's parliament was set to legalise same-sex marriage and adoption on Thursday, a landmark reform promoted by the conservative government over the opposition of the country's powerful Orthodox Church.Dozens of ruling New Democracy party legislators are expected to oppose the bill in a vote late Thursday. But support from opposition parties means it is certain to pass.The vote has been hailed as historic by LGBTQ associations, who said same-sex families face a labyrinth of administrative challenges amounting to discrimination under present family law.When their children fall ill in Greece, non-biological parents currently have no right to decide what medical procedures are necessary for them.Children do not automatically inherit from their non-biological parents.If a child has two fathers, they can only be registered with the civil registry and covered by social services by entering the name of the biological mother.And if the biological parent dies, the state can take away children from the other parent.- Church 'totally opposed' -Greece will become the first Orthodox Christian country, the 17th EU state and the 37th country in the world to legalise adoption by same-sex families.The bill is expected to split Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis's conservative New Democracy party, with dozens of the party's 158 lawmakers likely to oppose it or abstain.However, the bill is sure to pass with the support of the main opposition leftist Syriza party, whose leader Stefanos Kasselakis is gay, the socialist Pasok party and other smaller parties.A simple majority in the 300-member parliament vote is needed for the bill to pass.The Church of Greece -- which has close ties to many government MPs -- has said it is ""totally opposed"" to the reform, arguing that it ""condemns"" children to grow up in an ""environment of confusion"".The head of the church Archbishop Ieronymos slammed the proposed law as part of a bid to impose a ""new reality that seeks only to corrupt the homeland's social cohesion"".Some 4,000 people demonstrated in Athens against the measure on Sunday.Kasselakis, who married his partner in a US ceremony in October, has been subjected to homophobic insults, most recently from a central Greece mayor and an island group governor.Mitsotakis, who is personally championing the bill, was careful to stress last month that the changes would benefit just ""a few children and couples"".The conservative leader, who comfortably won re-election in June, had promised to enact the reform during his second four-year term.He announced it in January, just days after Kasselakis said Syriza would submit their own proposals for equality in marriage.- 'Day of joy' -Greek LGBTQ families, who had maintained a low profile since the reform was unveiled last month, have called for a celebratory gathering in Athens on Thursday.""This is a day of joy,"" Rainbow Families Greece, an NGO helping LGBTQ families, said on Facebook.""We will play with our children, and 'clean off' all the mud we have sustained all these years regarding who we are,"" the group said.Same-sex couples will still not be able to use assisted reproduction or a surrogate mother, procedures reserved for single women or heterosexual couples who have trouble conceiving.Greece had been condemned for anti-gay discrimination by the European Court of Human Rights in 2013, after gay couples were excluded from a 2008 civil uni.Opinion polls indicate that a majority of Greeks support same-sex marriage but oppose surrogacy.Under the Greek constitution, single parents, regardless of gender, have been allowed to adopt since 1946 -- but until now the second partner in a same-sex union was left out of the process.Under the previous Syriza government, Greece in 2015 legalised civil unions for same-sex couples, becoming one of the last countries in the European Union to grant such approval.That law had resolved property and inheritance issues, but made no provision for the adoption of children.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world.

It would be the first Orthodox Christian country to do so.The Valentine’s Day session in parliament follows vocal opposition and protests from the church but also a shift in public opinion which is narrowly supportive of the change.Lawmaker Maria Syrengela with the governing New Democracy party called the bill “a small contribution towards the creation of a society without discrimination” during the debate Wednesday. If approved as expected, the bill would grant same-sex couples full parental rights but not allow male partners to seek children born in Greece through surrogacy. READ MORE Same-sex marriage recognition follows decades of struggle for this rights campaigner in Greece Hundreds of protesters opposed to bill allowing same-sex marriage rally in Greek capital Students block Athens streets to protest private universities possibly coming to Greece The vote on the same-sex marriage bill is due Thursday. Here’s a look at the bill and why it’s happening now. THE SLOW ROAD TO CHANGEThe journey toward legalizing same-sex civil marriage in Greece has been long and contentious, with governments in the past shying away from a confrontation with the Orthodox Church.Civil partnerships for gay couples were made legal in 2015, with conservatives opposing the initiative. Promises to extend those rights were repeatedly deferred as the country emerged from a severe financial crisis followed by the pandemic. Many same-sex couples chose to tie the knot in one of more than a dozen other European Union countries which already have marriage equality laws, bypassing restrictions at home.Early in his second term, center-right Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is pushing through a series of difficult reforms that also include tackling fan violence in sport and ending an official state monopoly on higher education.WHY IS THE CHURCH STRONGLY OPPOSED?The Greek church’s opposition to the marriage bill has been emphatic.The governing Holy Synod of senior bishops sent letters to all lawmakers outlining its objections. A circular with similar wording was read out during Sunday services at all Orthodox churches in the country, and religious groups have staged public protests against the proposal. The church regards same-sex marriage as a threat to the traditional family model, arguing that support for that model could help address the declining birth rate in many European countries.Support for that view has been expressed by other Orthodox countries, significantly including the Ecumenical Patriarchate which is based in Istanbul, Turkey.Orthodox-majority countries are all located in eastern and southern Europe, where public acceptance of gay rights has been broadly more apprehensive than in western Europe.ADDITIONAL CHANGES SOUGHT Campaigners for LGBTQ+ rights are calling the bill a milestone reform, as same-sex couples would for the first time be recognized as a family unit. Partners who are not the biological parents of the couple’s children would have to seek guardianship through adoption, which is more time-consuming than the process in many other European countries.Transgender activists say they are likely to remain in legal limbo and are seeking additional changes to family law.A RARE POLITICAL AGREEMENTThe political landscape surrounding same-sex marriage is complicated, but it offers a rare moment of consensus at a time when politicians across the EU are keen to mark out their differences ahead of bloc-wide elections in June.Mitsotakis faces dissent from inside his own New Democracy party and needs opposition votes for the bill to pass.Many from the opposition are keen to back it. Stefanos Kasselakis, the opposition leader, last year became the first openly gay leader of a major Greek political party. Left-wing and centrist votes should provide a comfortable majority.Political parties on the far-right are aligned with religious protests. They are unlikely to topple the bill but are seeking to draw support away from Mitsotakis’ traditional conservative base of voters.

While Betts-Ramsey did not enter a plea this week, the court was told she denies any involvement in the attack. “We continue to appeal for anyone who may have been in the area or who believes they have further information to come forward and speak to us”, said lead investigator Detective Inspector Nicola Hannant. “We have increased police patrols in the area and would encourage people to approach these officers with any information or concerns.” The February 10 attack comes almost exactly one year to the day after another transgender teen, 16-year-old Brianna Ghey, was brutally stabbed to death by two other teens in a Northwest London park. “We are horrified to hear that yet another trans girl has been stabbed in the U.K. this past weekend,” Laura Mackay, CEO of LGBTQ+ youth organization Just Like Us, said in a statement. “No one should ever have to fear for their safety because they are part of the LGBT+ community.” “Just one year on from the murder of Brianna Ghey, we are still witnessing anti-trans jokes in Parliament, shocking comments across social media platforms, and newspaper headlines that seek to mock and vilify. It is clear that transphobia, in any guise and at any level, leads to devastating hate crimes,” Mackay’s statement continued. “Trans young people deserve to feel safe at home, at school, or while out roller-skating with their friends – the violence must stop.” In a world that should celebrate our unique journeys, it's heartbreaking to learn of the attack on an 18-year-old transgender girl, whose moment of joy at a roller-skating party was marred by violence and hatred.“Trans young people deserve to feel safe at home, at school, or… pic.twitter.com/iLs6TxCuRT— Just Like Us (@JustLikeUsUK) February 14, 2024 Don't forget to share: News (World) Anti-trans attack anti-trans violence London UK Support vital LGBTQ+ journalism Reader contributions help keep LGBTQ Nation free, so that queer people get the news they need, with stories that mainstream media often leaves out.

Israel-Hamas war Trump civil fraud verdict Charges in Kansas City shooting Navalny dies Election 2024 U.S. News Nebraska GOP bills target college professor tenure and diversity, equity and inclusion By MARGERY A. BECK Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print Scores of people turned out Tuesday to testify well into the night on bills being considered by Nebraska lawmakers that target diversity initiatives and higher education programs, mirroring proposals by Republicans across the country.The bills before the state Legislature’s Education Committee included one that would ban diversity, equity and inclusion — known as DEI — programs and offices at state colleges and universities. Another would eliminate tenure for college professors. Similar bills have been introduced in Republican-led legislatures across the country as the 2024 election year heats up.Sen. Dave Murman, a south-central Nebraska farmer who is chair of the Education Committee, introduced the anti-DEI bill that has garnered 13 cosigners who are among the most conservative in the body. Already this year, Republican lawmakers have proposed about 50 bills in 20 states that would restrict DEI initiatives or require their public disclosure. Murman characterized DEI programs as “a threat to academic freedom” by elevating diversity over meritocracy. READ MORE Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives limited at Kentucky colleges under Senate bill Republicans work to recruit female and minority candidates even as they criticize diversity programs Republican lawmakers are backing dozens of bills targeting diversity efforts on campus and elsewhere “Taxpayer-funded universities shouldn’t be used for activism and social change,” he said. The 12 people who testified in support of the bill echoed that sentiment, using phrases like “Marxist philosophy,” a “you-owe-me mentality” and “promoting victimhood.”Jess Lammers, of Holdrege, was more blunt, saying DEI is “being inflicted on us by liberals.”“It excludes white people,” he said. Opponents of the bill vastly outnumbered supporters, and dozens took to the mic to encourage lawmakers to reject it. Among them were several young people of color who grew up in the state or Nebraska college students who told lawmakers of the discrimination they’ve faced.That included Mia Perales, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln engineering student who graduated at the top of her high school class.“As a Latino woman in engineering, I have been overlooked by my peers countless times,” she said.Ricki Barber, the secretary of the Lincoln chapter of the NAACP, addressed lawmakers supporting the bill — several of whom are UNL graduates and Nebraska college football fans.“The transfer portal is a real thing,” Barber said. “And our Black athletes are watching what happens here.” Sen. Loren Lippincott defended his bill seeking to eliminate the tenure system as an idea that’s gaining traction in other state legislatures. He noted that similar measures have been or are actively being sought in at least half a dozen other states, including Iowa, Florida, North Dakota and Texas. Academic tenure is given to high-performing professors — usually those who are long-serving and have a catalog of published academic material. Tenure provides a raft of benefits, including higher pay and heightened job security. Advocates say tenure is crucial to protecting academic freedom.Critics have long held that tenure protects poorly performing professors. Many conservatives have come to see tenure as a system that protects professors who espouse left-leaning ideals.“A lot of these horses were pulling their weight in their youth,” Lippincott said. “But then those horses end up staying in the barn and just eating hay.”Lippincott’s bill would create a system that would set up annual performance evaluations of all faculty, along with a set of minimum standards of faculty performance and disciplinary actions. It would also set up employment agreements that would lay out grounds to fire faculty, including for just cause or for financial reasons and program discontinuance by the school. A handful of supporters testified in favor of the bill. Most cited a belief that it would help protect the free expression of conservative views of students who are too often silenced by professors who hold power over them.Opponents warned that eliminating tenure would make the already competitive nature of attracting top candidates for faculty jobs at Nebraska colleges and universities even more difficult.“Eliminating tenure would tie both behind our back right at a time we’re trying to recruit and retain faculty,” said Chris Kabourek, interim president of the University of Nebraska. “No other Big Ten university is without tenure. We can’t afford not to offer it.”It’s too early to know whether either measure has the votes to advance to the full Legislature.

Already this year, Republican lawmakers have proposed about 50 bills in 20 states that would restrict DEI initiatives or require their public disclosure.Murman characterized DEI programs as “a threat to academic freedom"" by elevating diversity over meritocracy.“Taxpayer-funded universities shouldn't be used for activism and social change,” he said.The 12 people who testified in support of the bill echoed that sentiment, using phrases like “Marxist philosophy,” a “you-owe-me mentality” and “promoting victimhood.”Jess Lammers, of Holdrege, was more blunt, saying DEI is “being inflicted on us by liberals.""“It excludes white people,” he said.Opponents of the bill vastly outnumbered supporters, and dozens took to the mic to encourage lawmakers to reject it. Among them were several young people of color who grew up in the state or Nebraska college students who told lawmakers of the discrimination they've faced.That included Mia Perales, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln engineering student who graduated at the top of her high school class.“As a Latino woman in engineering, I have been overlooked by my peers countless times,” she said.Ricki Barber, the secretary of the Lincoln chapter of the NAACP, addressed lawmakers supporting the bill — several of whom are UNL graduates and Nebraska college football fans.“The transfer portal is a real thing,” Barber said. “And our Black athletes are watching what happens here.”Sen. Loren Lippincott defended his bill seeking to eliminate the tenure system as an idea that's gaining traction in other state legislatures. He noted that similar measures have been or are actively being sought in at least half a dozen other states, including Iowa, Florida, North Dakota and Texas. Academic tenure is given to high-performing professors — usually those who are long-serving and have a catalog of published academic material. Tenure provides a raft of benefits, including higher pay and heightened job security. Advocates say tenure is crucial to protecting academic freedom.Critics have long held that tenure protects poorly performing professors. Many conservatives have come to see tenure as a system that protects professors who espouse left-leaning ideals.“A lot of these horses were pulling their weight in their youth,” Lippincott said. “But then those horses end up staying in the barn and just eating hay.”Lippincott's bill would create a system that would set up annual performance evaluations of all faculty, along with a set of minimum standards of faculty performance and disciplinary actions. It would also set up employment agreements that would lay out grounds to fire faculty, including for just cause or for financial reasons and program discontinuance by the school.A handful of supporters testified in favor of the bill. Most cited a belief that it would help protect the free expression of conservative views of students who are too often silenced by professors who hold power over them.Opponents warned that eliminating tenure would make the already competitive nature of attracting top candidates for faculty jobs at Nebraska colleges and universities even more difficult.“Eliminating tenure would tie both behind our back right at a time we're trying to recruit and retain faculty,” said Chris Kabourek, interim president of the University of Nebraska. “No other Big Ten university is without tenure. We can't afford not to offer it.”It's too early to know whether either measure has the votes to advance to the full Legislature.Top StoriesTrump wants to fire thousands of government workers.

(AP) — A Republican-backed measure to limit diversity, equity and inclusion practices at Kentucky’s public universities won approval from the state Senate on Tuesday after an emotional debate that delved into race relations and what the bill’s sponsor portrayed as the liberal bent on college campuses. The bill cleared the Senate on a 26-7 vote after a nearly two-hour debate, sending the proposal to the House. The GOP has supermajorities in both chambers. One Democratic lawmaker, predicting a legal challenge, said the final arbiters could be the courts. Debates revolving around initiatives on diversity, equity and inclusion — known as DEI — are playing out in statehouses across the country. So far this year, GOP lawmakers have proposed about 50 bills in 20 states that would restrict DEI initiatives or require their public disclosure, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural. Meanwhile, Democrats have filed about two dozen bills in 11 states that would require or promote DEI initiatives. In Kentucky, opponents warned the proposed restrictions on campuses could roll back gains in minority enrollments and stifle campus discussions on topics dealing with past discrimination. The legislation, among other things, would bar public colleges and universities from providing preferential treatment based on a person’s political ideology. It would prohibit the schools from requiring people to state specific ideologies or beliefs when seeking admission, employment or promotions. Republican Sen. Mike Wilson said he filed the bill to counter a broader trend in higher education toward denying campus jobs or promotions to faculty refusing to espouse “liberal ideologies fashionable in our public universities.” He said such practices have extended to students and staff as well. “Diversity of thought should be welcomed in our universities and higher education,” Wilson said. “But we’ve seen a trend across the United States of forcing faculty, in order to remain employed, to formally endorse a set of beliefs that may be contrary to their own, all in violation of the First Amendment.” Democratic Sen. Reginald Thomas said the proposed restrictions would jeopardize successes in expanding the number of minority students on Kentucky’s university campuses. “The richness of our diversity and our differences, that’s what makes us strong,” said Thomas, who is Black. “We are like a quilt here in America.” Wilson responded that there’s nothing in the bill to prohibit colleges from supporting diversity initiatives, as long as those efforts don’t include “discriminatory concepts.” The legislation sets out a host of such concepts that would be prohibited, among them that a person, based on their race or gender, bears responsibility for past actions committed by other members of the same race or gender. Another is meant to keep people from feeling guilt or discomfort solely because of their race or gender. The state attorney general’s office would be allowed to take legal action to compel a school’s compliance. Other senators opposing the bill warned that its restrictions could have a chilling effect on what’s taught on college campuses. They pointed to the women’s suffrage movement and the landmark Supreme Court ruling that outlawed segregation of public schools as possible examples of topics that could be excluded. In supporting the bill, GOP Sen. Phillip Wheeler said it’s important for students to delve into the past and learn about the struggles of people. The bill attempts to “get to a balance, to where we’re no longer looked at as the oppressors and the oppressees, that we are each judged on our own merit,” he said. “I think that some of the vitriol that occurs on the campuses, some of the topics, have really done more to divide us than unite us,” he added. The Supreme Court’s June decision ending affirmative action at universities has created a new legal landscape around diversity programs in the workplace and civil society. On Tuesday, one of the most emotional moments of the Kentucky Senate debate came when Republican Sen. Donald Douglas talked about his own life experiences, recalling that some classmates believed he got into medical school because he was a Black athlete, despite his academic achievements. “You know how embarrassed I was?” Douglas said in supporting the bill. “How embarrassed I was to tell them I had an academic scholarship to medical school and I had to explain, as a Black man, how I got a scholarship to medical school?” The changes proposed in the bill will be painful for some people, Douglas acknowledged. But he predicted that most affected students will “succeed with vigor and they will succeed with a sense that they are responsible for their success and not just the system.” ___ The legislation is Senate Bill 6.

That is ""a 70% increase from the 10% counted in Nielsen’s 2020 report.""There is an even higher percentage of LGBTQ gamers among younger age groups, with ""23 to 28% of gamers under 35 identifying as LGBTQ,"" the report said.And they are dedicating quite a bit of time to their video games, according to the survey, with the ""majority (69%) of LGBTQ gamers playing 4-plus hours per week on PCs or consoles, compared to 64% of non-LGBTQ gamers.""But the games don't exactly reflect the LGBTQ community that is playing them and appears to be lagging behind other media when it comes to inclusivity and representation.Nintendo Switch:8 cozy games to check out on Nintendo Switch, from 'Palia' to 'No Man's Sky'What players want to see in video gamesGLAAD counted the games tagged as having LGBTQ content and notes that, as of November 2023, ""these games account for less than 2% of Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo’s total digital libraries. For Steam, it is less than 2.5%, but drops to just 1.7% when adult-only games are excluded.""The GLAAD study also found that LGBTQ gamers were more likely to play on Nintendo's Switch consoles, but that the Nintendo Switch eShop, by their count, ""has the lowest percentage of available games that contain LGBTQ characters or storylines.""It's not clear why there is such a lack of inclusion when LGBTQ gamers make up a critical part of the gaming audience, but the GLAAD report offers these possible reasons why in a statement: ""Some reasons for exclusion are passive. Often, game companies have not considered that they should represent LGBTQ people, nor do they see us as a major part of the core gaming audience. Some reasons for exclusion are active. Companies worry about pushing away a core audience that they assume are resistant or hostile to LGBTQ content.""But seeing characters that have their identity or orientation can have a big positive impact on LGBTQ gamers, in particular younger players, while having little negative impact on non-LGBTQ gamers.A need for inclusion:Issa Rae says Hollywood needs to be accountable. Here's why diverse shows are so importantHarmful stereotypes in games, however, affect both groups. According to the study, ""70% of LGBTQ gamers and 46% of non-LGBTQ gamers are less likely to buy or play a game if it contains harmful tropes or stereotypes about the LGBTQ community. Notably, 51% of heavy/core gamers are less likely to buy or play such a game.""The GLAAD report offers recommendations for the video game industry, suggesting that:the percentage of games with LGBTQ representation should be proportional to the numbers of gamers who are LGBTQdevelopers should strive for representation that promotes inclusivity and acceptancethe industry should take responsibility for making gaming communities more inclusivecompanies should consult LGBTQ media content expertsthere should be more hiring of LGBTQ game industry workers in positions of authorityFeatured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software© 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."

While LGBTQ representation in video games has improved over recent years, a new report suggests the industry still has a long way to go. LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD published a report on Tuesday titled ‘The State of LGBTQ inclusion in Video Games’, which breaks down the industry’s reach to queer players, their playing habits, and how much of the gaming audience falls within that bracket. According to the report, which covered 1,452 active PC and console gamers between June and August of last year, 17% of active gamers identify as LGBTQ. This is a 70% increase from a Nielsen survey conducted in 2020 which counted 10%. The percentage of LGBTQ players is notably higher among younger age groups, with 23-28% of all gamers under 35 identifying as LGBTQ. These figures are in stark contrast to the amount of LGBTQ characters and storylines in games. According to the report, less than 2% of games on the Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo digital libraries are tagged with the LGBTQ label. Steam has 2.5%, but this drops to 1.7% when adult-only games are excluded. There’s no indication that GLAAD based these findings on anything other than shop tags though, which could easily be inaccurate. Elsewhere, the report finds 68% of LGBTQ players wished games featured more prominent queer storylines. 21% of non-LGBTQ gamers, and 29% of gamers overall, also wish this was the case. It also suggests online harassment is still a big issue. 52% of LGBTQ gamers said they had experienced harassment while playing online, compared to 38% of non-LGBTQ players. 42% of LGBTQ gamers meanwhile said they had avoided a game altogether because they thought they might be harassed, while 27% quit a game because of it.

Read More StoriesSumming up the findings, Blair Durkee, associate director of gaming at GLAAD, said: ‘We believe that LGBTQ inclusion benefits both the video game industry and community. As this report shows, the presence of LGBTQ characters or storylines doesn’t meaningfully deter non-LGBTQ people from buying or playing games, but it makes a huge difference to LGBTQ gamers. ‘Despite the significant progress we’ve seen, gaming remains woefully behind other forms of entertainment media when it comes to representation.’ You can find the full report on the GLAAD website.

LGBTQ representation is higher among younger demographics, with 23-28% of those under 35 identifying as LGBTQ.Despite this sizable LGBTQ player base, the report highlights a lack of representation in games. Fewer than 2% of games on major platforms feature LGBTQ characters or content.Interestingly, LGBTQ gamers' spending habits align closely with their non-LGBTQ counterparts, with similar expenditure patterns across various spending brackets.Differences emerge in-game preferences, with LGBTQ gamers showing a preference for single-player and cooperative multiplayer games over competitive multiplayer titles, possibly influenced by the high levels of harassment LGBTQ players experience.Over half of LGBTQ players report experiencing harassment in games, compared to 28% of non-LGBTQ players. Consequently, 42% of LGBTQ players have avoided games due to expected harassment, and 27% have stopped playing games altogether due to harassment.Read Next: 'The Sims 4' Now Lets You Choose Custom GendersImage credits: Blablo101 on Shutterstock.Loading...Loading...© 2024 Benzinga.com.

A recent study by GLAAD finds that there is a notable deficit in LGBTQ-inclusive gaming content available to the public. File Photo by Keizo Mori/UPI | License Photo Feb. 13 (UPI) -- A new study on LGBTQ-inclusive video gaming shows that less than 2% of games currently available on the market take into account LGBTQ-related content and characters. The study by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation advocacy group was published Tuesday and shows that, despite nearly 1 in every 5 active gamers identifying as LGBTQ, there appears to be a gap in related gaming content. Advertisement GLAAD's top executive said data also shows that the combined estimated global revenue of gaming has surpassed that of film entertainment and recorded music. ""This report was created to educate the game industry on the current state of LGBTQ representation that exists, make a facts-based business case for LGBTQ inclusion, and provide a playbook for more authentic representation,"" wrote GLAAD's CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. Related GLAAD report finds social media feeds into real-world danger for LGBTQ people Loud video games could damage hearing Study suggests video games boost intelligence in children White House announces new steps to protect LGBTQ communities GLAAD used as a measurement the number of available games on the market with LGBTQ-related gaming content versus the total number of games currently available. In doing so, GLAAD said the study's authors found less than 2% of LGBTQ inclusion was seen on Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo gaming platforms. LGBTQ gamers comprise nearly 20% of what is called ""heavy"" or ""core"" users who play video games more than 10 hours per week. Advertisement ""The percentage of LGBTQ gamers is even higher among younger age groups, with 23 to 28% of gamers under 35 identifying as LGBTQ,"" the study's creators said. GLAAD said that there are multiple reasons, some of which are passive, for the lack of LGBTQ representation in the gaming industry. Gaming companies, according to GLAAD, often ""have not considered that they should represent LGBTQ people."" Their study suggests that companies, likewise, do not ""see [LGBTQ gamers] as a major part of the core gaming audience."" It also said other exclusionary reasons ""are active."" The GLAAD report said that companies ""worry about pushing away a core audience that they assume are resistant or hostile to LGBTQ content."" But the opinions by players toward LGBTQ game characters appear to be indifferent. When asked the question if a player had any feelings toward having an LGBTQ character in the storyline, 70% of players said it made no different in their decision to purchase a particular game. ""The resistance toward LGBTQ content in games is waning, as each successive generation of gamers is more diverse and more open to seeing LGBTQ representation in their games,"" said GLAAD. ""GLAAD's finding that 17% of active gamers are LGBTQ, and the growth from 10% of active gamers being LGBTQ from Nielsen's Games360 study in 2020, proves their tremendous influence on the gaming industry,"" said Stacie de Armas, Nielsen's Senior Vice President of Diverse Insights and Initiatives. Advertisement The study also points to economic factors at play, as well. According to Armas, for LGBTQ gamers, ""a safe and inclusive environment goes beyond the game itself with nearly 70% indicating they are less likely to buy from a studio with a history of mistreating LGBTQ workers.""

The character Ellie in ""The Last of Us Part I.""Playstation/Sony Interactive Entertainment Key Facts GLAAD, a non-profit LGBTQ advocacy group, on Tuesday released its first ever inclusion report with Nielsen Games that shows 17% of gamers aged 13 to 55 identify as LGBTQ, up significantly from the 10% who said the same in a 2020 Nielsen report and much higher than the 7.1% of American adults who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, according to a 2022 Gallup poll. That number is poised to increase in coming years, the study said, as a significantly higher 23% to 28% of gamers under 35 years old identify as LGBTQ and almost one in five members of Generation Z, not just gamers, say they're gay, bisexual or transgender. However, a majority of games lackf LGBTQ characters or storylines, with such inclusive games making up only 2% of Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo’s total digital libraries, GLAAD’s report says. The study found that the Nintendo eShop has the lowest number of games tagged as having LGBTQ content with 50, followed by PlayStation with 90, Microsoft with 146 and Steam with 2,302 English games, though that number drops to 1,506 when games with “adult only sexual content” were filtered out. In the broader context of entertainment, GLAAD found that the gaming industry lags behind that of advertising (3% of ads reviewed in GLAAD's Advertising Visibility Index included LGBTQ representation), primetime television (10.6% of scripted series contained an LGBTQ regular in the 2022-23 season) and films from top-10 distributors (28.5% of which include an LGBTQ character). Catering to an LGBTQ audience would be good for companies, GLAAD argued, citing that queer gamers are 1.4 times more likely to buy or play a game with a character that matches their gender, 29% of all gamers wish there were more prominent LGBTQ storylines in games and 70% of LGBTQ gamers (as well as 46% of non-LGBTQ gamers) are less likely to buy a game if it contains harmful tropes or stereotypes about the gay or transgender community. Art created for Riot Games' celebration of Pride Month.Luz Danaee/Riot Games Crucial Quote “Game companies have avoided making more games with central LGBTQ characters because they have assumed that the majority of the gaming audience would not be interested in or openly reject such games,” the GLAAD study reads. “However, our research found that having games with central/main LGBTQ characters would make no difference to the majority of non-LGBTQ gamers.” Tangent Video games have also historically struggled with gender and racial representation. Of the 100 top-selling and major games released between 2017 and 2021, 80% had male main characters and 61% of characters in games are white, according to a Diamond Lobby study. When video games do feature women in prominent roles, they’re often over-sexualized or cast as the damsel-in-distress, tropes that have been criticized in Blockbuster games like ""Tomb Raider,” ""Mortal Kombat"" and “Grant Theft Auto.” Key Background The Entertainment Software Association in July found that 65% of Americans play video games—about 212.6 million weekly players. Of those people, slightly more than half (53%) identify as men and 72% are white. The average gamer is 32 years old with 21 years of gaming experience under their belt. In a study the year before, the association found that nearly all Americans (97%) say they're able to see the benefits of video games when it comes to stress relief, cognitive skill improvement, social connection and increasing problem solving skills. Overall, the perception of video games and their impact on players' lives have improved in the last 40 or so years. Historically, those who worry about the negative impacts have expressed concerns with desensitization to violence, inappropriate sexual themes, portrayal of religion and the reinforcement of sexist stereotypes.

The report presents extensive data and guidelines that can be used by parents, caregivers, school administrators, educators, counselors and other youth-serving professionals to better understand and support Black LGBTQ+ youth. Despite some of the solemn statistics presented throughout the report, Black LGBTQ+ youth are finding the confidence to own their space by opening up to loved ones about their sexuality—most notably with their friends—with 96.9% out to their LGBTQ+ friends and 91.8% were out to their non-LGBTQ+ friends. Additionally, over half of Black LGBTQ+ youth and Black Transgender/Gender-expansive youth are out to their teachers and other school staff, exemplifying the growth needed to ensure Black queer youth know they are valued. ""This report highlights the nuance of what it means to be Black and queer in America,"" said Charleigh Flohr, Associate Director of Public Education & Research at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. ""There's been a noticeable increase in Black openly LGBTQ+ youth, and more work is needed to ensure they are seen and affirmed. Our hope is this report will provide insight on how allies can provide a safe and affirming space for Black LGBTQ+ youth to live in their truth."" Key findings from the 2024 Black LGBTQ+ Youth Report include: Racism, Homophobia and Transphobia 80.9% of Black LGBTQ+ youth and 83.5% of Black transgender/gender-expansive youth say they have experienced homophobia or transphobia in the Black community 74.8% of Black LGBTQ+ youth and 78.2% of Black transgender and gender-expansive youth have experienced racism in the LGBTQ+ community Religion, Faith and Spirituality 63.1% of those raised in a religion said their religion is unfriendly to LGBTQ+ people 54.5% said their religious beliefs triggered feelings of guilt and shame when they came out as an LGBTQ+ person Mental Health 53.3% of Black LGBTQ+ youth screened positive for depression 46.5% of Black LGBTQ+ youth wanted therapy but could not receive it Black LGBTQ+ Youth Futures 33.7% of Black LGBTQ+ youth want to attend an HBCU because they believe they will be more supported at an HBCU Only 54.4% of Black LGBTQ+ youth feel like they will be able to be their authentic self when applying for jobs in the future.

Through its programs, the HRC Foundation seeks to make transformational change in the everyday lives of LGBTQ+ people, shedding light on inequity and deepening the public's understanding of LGBTQ+ issues, with a clear focus on advancing transgender and racial justice. Its work has transformed the landscape for more than 15 million workers, 11 million students, 1 million clients in the adoption and foster care system and so much more. The HRC Foundation provides direct consultation and technical assistance to institutions and communities, driving the advancement of inclusive policies and practices; it builds the capacity of future leaders and allies through fellowship and training programs; and, with the firm belief that we are stronger working together, it forges partnerships with advocates in the U.S. and around the globe to increase our impact and shape the future of our work.

Israel-Hamas war Trump civil fraud verdict Charges in Kansas City shooting Navalny dies Election 2024 AP Fact Check The Texas megachurch shooter has not been identified as transgender, despite claims online Houston Police officers watch over displaced churchgoers outside Lakewood Church, Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024, in Houston, after a reported shooting during a Spanish church service. Social media users are falsely claiming that the shooter has been identified as transgender. (Karen Warren/Houston Chronicle via AP) By MELISSA GOLDIN Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print CLAIM: The shooter who carried out an attack injuring two people at a Texas megachurch on Sunday has been identified as transgender.AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Houston police said on Monday that its investigation has thus far determined that the shooter, Genesse Ivonne Moreno, identified as female despite using multiple aliases, including the name Jeffery — or Jeffrey — Escalante. Multiple court records identify Moreno as female, most recently in 2022.THE FACTS: Amid the aftermath of Sunday’s shooting at Lakewood Church, which is led by televangelist pastor Joel Osteen, social media users spread false claims about Moreno’s gender identity. “BREAKING: Lakewood Church shooter identified as transgender, legal name Genesse Moreno but went by the name ‘Jeffrey,’” reads one post on X, formerly Twitter, that had received approximately 9,100 likes and 6,100 shares as of Tuesday. READ MORE NOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn’t happen this week Posts share erroneous information about suspect identification in Kansas City mass shooting Tucker Carlson was not put on a ‘kill list’ in Ukraine for Putin interview Others claimed that Moreno, who was fatally shot in an exchange of gunfire, had been born as Jeffery, but went by Genesse as part of her transition. Officials have not found any evidence that Moreno was transgender. Police said she used male and female aliases, but that investigators who looked at past police reports determined she identified as female.“We do have reports she used multiple aliases, including Jeffery Escalante,” Houston Police Commander Chris Hassig said about 19 minutes into a press conference on Monday. “So she has utilized both male and female names, but through all of our investigation to this point, talking with individuals, interviews, documents, Houston Police Department reports, she has been identified this entire time as female, she, her. And so we are identifying her as Genesse Moreno, Hispanic female.Records in Harris County, where Houston is located, show that Moreno, under the names Jeffery G. Escalante-Moreno or Jeffery G. Escalante, was charged in six criminal cases from 2005 to 2011. She is identified as female in all of them. A case filed in nearby Katy County after Moreno’s latest arrest in April 2022 also lists her as female, but with the name Genesse Ivonne Moreno. William Capasso, an attorney in Houston who represented Moreno for a portion of her divorce proceedings in 2021 to 2022, told The Associated Press that she went by Jeffrey Moreno-Carranza at the time. He said Carranza was her married name and noted that at that time “there was no indication that she was transgender.”“It is my understanding that although her birth name was Jeffrey Moreno, she was born female and identified as a female,” he wrote in an email. “She did use Genesse and may have changed her name to Genesse Moreno after I represented her.”Capasso added that Moreno used the name “Jeffrey Genesse Escalante Moreno” on her son’s birth certificate. He said he withdrew as Moreno’s attorney in the proceedings because he was not able to communicate with her effectively.Many social media posts used claims about Moreno’s gender identity to advance a baseless narrative that there has been a rise in transgender or nonbinary mass shooters in recent years. This narrative previously spread widely in March 2023, after an assailant who identified as transgender killed six people at a Nashville private school.Gender and criminology experts told The Associated Press at the time that mass casualty shootings perpetrated by someone identifying as transgender or nonbinary are rare and that those groups are far more likely to be the victims of violence.Authorities said on Monday that Moreno used a legally purchased AR-15 style rifle to carry out the attack at Lakewood Church, one of the biggest megachurches in the U.S. She was shot and killed by two off-duty officers working security at the building. Two other people were shot and wounded, including Moreno’s young son, who she brought with her to the church.___This is part of the AP’s effort to address widely shared false and misleading information that is circulating online.

Accept Youth Black trans, nonbinary youth have higher suicide risk than cisgender queer peers (exclusive) Shutterstock A new Trevor Project report details the challenges faced by Black LGBTQ+ young people and how they differ within this population.Trudy RingFebruary 13 2024 12:44 PM ESTFebruary 13 2024 12:44 PM ESTtrudestressBlack LGBTQ+ young people are experiencing high rates of discrimination and victimization — and with that comes a high suicide risk, especially among transgender, nonbinary, and questioning Black youth, says a new report from the Trevor Project.Twenty-one percent of Black trans, nonbinary, and questioning young people reported a suicide attempt in the past year, notes the Trevor Project’s research brief, titled “Discrimination Among Black LGBTQ+ Young People and Suicide Risk,” released Tuesday and based on data collected through the Trevor Project’s 2023 U.S. National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ Young People. That compares to just 8 percent of Black cisgender LGBQ youth.The difference is “not surprising” but “telling,” says Derrick Matthews, director of research science at the Trevor Project and lead author of the brief.“No single factor or experience definitively causes someone to have higher odds of considering or attempting suicide,” he tells The Advocate via email. “However, these data show that experiences of gender discrimination were associated with higher odds of suicide risk for Black transgender, nonbinary, and questioning young people. Intersecting identities are imperative to analyze when we talk about experiences of discrimination because, simply put, the more marginalized identities a person holds, the more opportunities they have to be discriminated against.”“This signals a greater need for allies, advocates, families, and friends to better support and affirm the gender-expansive Black LGBTQ+ young people in their lives — in a way that may vary from how we might show up for cisgender Black LGBQ youth,” Matthews notes.Demonstrating the pervasiveness of discrimination, 70 percent of Black cis LGBQ youth reported experiencing discrimination based on their race, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression in the past year, while the proportion was even greater — 83 percent — among Black trans, nonbinary, or questioning youth. The majority reported experiencing two or more forms of discrimination. Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity or expression were both associated with a heightened risk of suicide. But many who’d experienced this discrimination also reported receiving support from someone in their life, such as a friend, a romantic partner, a therapist, or a sibling.Shutterstock“Although these results can be dispiriting, we encourage all LGBTQ+ youth-facing people to use these findings to bolster efforts to both end discrimination and address its effects head on,” the report says. “Black LGBTQ+ young people themselves have not only acknowledged the role of intersectional discrimination in their own lives, but have shaped their activism to be intersectional to combat it as well. Adults working with Black LBGTQ+ young people should ensure that they are prepared to support all aspects of Black LGBTQ+ young people’s identities as they navigate the combined effects of racism, anti-LGBTQ bigotry, and other forms of bias.”“While there will always be a role for providing services to help Black LGBTQ+ young people cope with the effects of living in a discriminatory social environment, we must also not lose sight that the goal must always be to reduce exposure to discrimination in the first place,” the brief continues. “We should celebrate the resilience of Black LGBTQ+ young people for thriving, but that cannot absolve us of a collective responsibility to move closer to a world where that resilience is not a necessary part of survival.”Matthews noted that Black LGBTQ+ young people aren't inherently proned to a higher risk of suicide. “Rather, they are placed at higher risk because of how they are mistreated and stigmatized by others,"" he explained. ""These findings are difficult. But they should serve as a call to action for allies, advocates, youth-serving professionals, and adults everywhere: It’s time to step up our efforts to let Black trans and nonbinary young people know that we are here for them by working to reduce their experiences of discrimination — and reminding them that this world really is a better place because they are in it.”If you are having thoughts of suicide or are concerned that someone you know may be, resources are available to help.

For her two mums, Christina Leimoni and Victoria Kalfaki, their dream may soon become real, as Greece stands on the brink of legalising same-sex marriage.Parliament will vote on the bill, introduced by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, on Thursday. Facing dissent from members of his own centre-right party, he will need to rely on support from the left-wing opposition to get it through.Christina and Victoria will be there inside the chamber, willing it to pass. Two years ago, they returned to Greece from the UK, where they had moved for work - and to live their relationship freely.They married in the UK and Niovi was born there. If the law passes, they plan to have their marriage recognised under Greek law.'I have no say'After Niovi's birth in London, they tried to register her at the Greek embassy, but were rebuffed. ""The commentary was, 'You should have thought before having her',"" Christina recalls.""It was awful, I cried in the car for 45 minutes, I couldn't stop - it still brings bad memories,"" Victoria says, welling up with tears. ""It's like being rejected by your country.""Image caption, Niovi was born in the UK and is now four years oldWithout legal recognition for their marriage in Greece, only Victoria, who gave birth to Niovi, is accepted as her mother, even though the egg was from Christina.At school, she has no say over decisions and when Niovi has been admitted to hospital, Christina has been barred from entering her room.""My biggest fear is that if anything really bad happens to Victoria and she dies, our child instantly goes to social services, who then see if any of Victoria's relatives want to adopt her,"" she says.""If they don't, she goes into an institution. I have no say. So the child wouldn't just lose one mother, she'd lose both of us.""Opposition by the ChurchFifteen of the European Union's 27 members have already legalised same-sex marriage. It is permitted in 35 countries worldwide. Greece has lagged behind European neighbours largely because of opposition from its powerful church. If the law passes this week, it would become the first Christian Orthodox-majority country, and the first in Europe's southeast, to have marriage equality.Same-sex couples would also be legally allowed to adopt children but not to have a baby through a surrogate - a recourse that is only legal here for heterosexual couples who have a medical need for assisted reproduction.""Greece geographically is in the southeast, but culturally and politically it belongs to the West,"" says Alex Patelis, the prime minister's chief economic advisor and a member of the committee that drafted the marriage bill.Image caption, Equal rights fit the centre-right government's ideology, says PM's advisor Alex PatelisMr Mitsotakis, recently storming to re-election, faces a weak opposition that has left him the space to tread onto their political turf without jeopardising his own position.Mr Patelis says the bill is a cornerstone of the prime minister's beliefs: ""It's often thought that human rights and equality are the purview of the parties of the left. This is coming from a centre-right party - and it's important to recognise that equality under law and individual rights are also the ideology of the right.""But Greek society is split. A recent poll for Proto Thema newspaper found 55% in favour of same-sex marriage and an even slimmer majority backing adoption.Up to 50 of Mr Mitsotakis's 158 MPs are expected either to vote against the bill or to be conveniently absent from the chamber, meaning they can duck the vote.A letter by the Church of Greece opposing the move was read out in morning mass across the country earlier this month, condemning what it said would ""promote the abolition of fatherhood and motherhood… and put the sexual choices of homosexual adults above the interests of future children"".Image caption, Greece's powerful Orthodox Church has galvanised protests against same-sex marriageOne of the most outspoken prelates has been Bishop Seraphim of Piraeus. At the city's Agii Anargiri Church, we watch as he leads a packed service, with worshippers in their Sunday best kissing icons and bowing heads.He recently warned that he would block MPs who back the bill from his church, adding it would be preferable if they had not been born. And, he said, he would refuse to baptise children of same-sex couples ""to help them understand that what their guardians are doing is a sin.""Outside parliament on Syntagma Square, opponents gather to protest against the bill, beneath banners reading ""No children for perverts"" and chanting ""Take your hands off our kids"".A video shows images including religious icons and, oddly, Bill Gates. Conspiracy theories about a new global order being imposed on Greece have blended with pious Greeks who believe their traditions are being destroyed.""The Bible says marriage is between a man and a woman - and anything else is a big sin,"" says Rallou Perperidou. ""Like Sodom and Gomorrah, God destroyed people practising homosexuality. God will forgive them if they accept what they do is wrong and denounce it.""Image caption, Protesters hold a banner that reads ""Take your hands off our kids. There's only one family, the traditional one.""Kyriaki Chantzara, 38, is at the protest with her sister, who is expecting her tenth child. ""Homosexual people cannot give the right example for children because we think the existence of a female and male example is crucial to them. It is a human right for every child to have a father and a mother,"" she says.Back in northern Athens, four-year-old Niovi is practising her English with nursery rhymes. Her mums help as she reads ""Hickory Dickory Dock, the mouse ran up the clock…""As time ticks towards the parliamentary vote, the women say their excitement is building. ""I'm amazingly happy about it,"" says Christina. ""It's the start of accepting diversity in general as a country and accepting that all people have equal rights. And for us it will mean reality, because I am Niovi's mother, and this should be supported by the law. The legislation will bring truth to the reality.""Additional reporting by Kostas KallergisRelated TopicsGreeceSurrogacyLGBTKyriakos MitsotakisAdoptionMore on this story'We're under attack' - how life is changing for Italy's gay familiesPublished23 September 2023Spain’s LGBT matador: 'More will come out because of me'Published6 days agoRussian court bans 'LGBT movement'Published30 November 2023Top StoriesLive. ‘Putin is responsible’ - Biden speaks out after report of Navalny’s deathTrump ordered to pay $354m in New York fraud casePublished10 hours agoTrump must pay $354m.

Her fight may finally be over this week – a few months shy of her twin boys’ 17th birthday.Greek lawmakers are expected to legalize same-sex marriage in a parliament vote Thursday, with a rare display of cross-party collaboration.Approval would make Greece the first Orthodox Christian country to take that step, clearing multiple legal hurdles for gay couples who already have or want to have children.“I’ve been fighting for this ever since I figured out who I was,” says Belia, a 57-year-old drama teacher with a gruff voice and an easy laugh.“And it’s a great relief to say we’ve finally made it,” she said. “But it is tiresome, very tiresome to fight for something that’s an obvious right – to suffer for something that other people are just handed – and have to fight so hard to get it.” Belia split with her female partner when her sons were aged 11 but she considers her to be the boys’ other mother.Although civil partnerships were extended to gay couples in Greece nearly a decade ago, only the biological parents of children in those relationships are currently recognized as legal guardians.The issue of children’s rights, including the publicized plight of cancer survivors in a same-sex relationship, helped nudge public opinion toward narrowly favoring the bill that was sponsored by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ conservative government.But it also triggered a strong reaction from the country’s Orthodox Church. Representing Greece’s dominant faith, the Church argues the marriage bill would confuse parental roles and weaken the traditional family.The Church petitioned lawmakers to reconsider in a public appeal also read out at Sunday services.Several prominent bishops have taken a tougher line, warning that they will refuse to baptize the children of gay couples. They allied with far-right political parties and traditionalist groups to stage public demonstrations.Protester Chara Giannakantonaki said she felt compelled to attend a rally held in front of parliament last Sunday. “Every minority already has its rights guaranteed. There is no issue. They don’t need (same-sex) marriage. They just want to desecrate whatever has remained sacred in Greece: Our Church, our families and our children,” she said. “But children are a red line and we will never accept this.”The Mitsotakis government is facing dissent among conservatives over the bill and will need support from the centrist and left-wing opposition to secure the 151-vote minimum in the 300-member parliament.Dimitris Mavros, managing director of the market research firm MRB Hellas, said the timing of the bill appeared to be carefully calculated: Backing a measure that props up Mitsotakis’ centrist credentials but with the controversy likely to blow over before the European Union-wide elections in June.Greeks in 2024, Mavros said, have shown a sharp rise in financial anxiety, their worries reflected in recent strikes and ongoing farmers’ protests.“I think the farmers’ (protests) and high prices – and issues that hurt people’s pockets – are going to overshadow the same-sex couples issue,” he said. “We’re probably going to get past this calmly.”Chrysa Gkotsopoulou and Elena Kotsifi, both engineers, for years told their families and colleagues they were roommates and only came out as a couple after moving to England for work in 2015.They now have a young daughter, Ariadne, and all three travel to Greece using their U.K. passports. “We quickly realized that England offered us prospects as a couple that we had never previously imagined.” Kotsifi, 38, said. “We could be ourselves.”They flew to Athens at the weekend to celebrate the bill’s expected approval, and said that for the first time in nearly a decade, they now view returning home as a possibility.They hope to join the activist Belia and others Thursday night in the public gallery in parliament and celebrations set to follow.“If there’s room for us (in parliament), we’d like to go,” Gkotsopoulou said. “We feel joy, joy and pride that Greece is moving to the right side of history.”More aboutAPGreeceAthensKyriakos MitsotakisGreekGreeksChurchOrthodox ChurchEnglandEuropean Union1/1For rights campaigner in Greece, same-sex marriage recognition follows decades of struggleFor rights campaigner in Greece, same-sex marriage recognition follows decades of struggleGreece Same Sex MarriageCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

Members of the FBI, the Texas Rangers, the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office and the Conroe and Houston Police Departments were investigating a property Monday in Conroe, north of Houston, that was believed to be Moreno's residence, KPRC reported. In a press conference held on Sunday afternoon, Houston Police Chief Troy Finner detailed that Moreno, dressed in a trench coat and carrying a backpack, entered the church shortly before 2 p.m. and began firing. According to a search warrant issued by the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office on Monday, officers ""shot and killed her in self-defense"" when she aimed her firearm at them. The police chief reported that her son sustained a gunshot wound to the head amidst the gunfire and, as of Monday, is still hospitalized in critical condition. A man who was injured and shot in the leg, received medical attention at a hospital and has since been discharged, according to Finner's statement on Monday. He has been identified in the search warrant as Tom George Thomas. ""We don't understand why all these things happened, but we know God's in control,"" Osteen said following the shooting.

Accept Crime Transgender people are being killed at an alarming rate, especially in the South (exclusive) Shutterstock New findings reveal a disturbing increase in violence against transgender individuals, spotlighting the South’s lax gun laws and discriminatory policies.Christopher WigginsFebruary 13 2024 8:00 AM ESTFebruary 13 2024 8:49 AM ESTCwnewserIn a revealing new report by Everytown for Gun Safety, a disturbing trend has been highlighted, showcasing a rise in homicides of transgender people across the United States, with a troubling concentration in the Southern states. This comprehensive analysis, running from 2017 through 2023, sheds light on the urgent need for awareness and action against the violence that disproportionately affects the transgender community.Keep up with the latest in LGBTQ+ news and politics. Sign up for The Advocate's email newsletter.In an in-depth interview with The Advocate, Sarah Burd-Sharps, senior director of research at Everytown for Gun Safety, shared insights into the findings and the pressing implications of this data. She emphasized the dire connection between firearms and the murders of transgender people amid a challenging landscape where a lot of data wasn’t readily available.“We started tracking the homicides of transgender and gender-expansive people in 2017 because there was very little understanding of the link between gun violence and violence against the transgender community,” Burd-Sharps said.The report documents 263 homicides over the seven years, with an alarming increase in incidents, particularly in 2023. With approximately three-quarters of these homicides involving a gun, the report underscores the critical nature of addressing gun violence as a key factor in these tragic deaths. A stark revelation from the study is the disproportionate impact on Black transgender women, who represent a substantial majority of the victims, further magnified by the prevalence of firearm use in these crimes.Related: Trans People Continue to Be Murdered at Extreme Rates as Republicans Push Transphobic LawsBurd-Sharps pointed out the correlation between the surge in anti-transgender sentiment, particularly in the South, and the rising instances of violence.“Nearly half of these incidents involving guns are in the south, in southern states,” she said, explaining that trans people in the South face specific dangers.She attributed this trend to a combination of lax gun laws and discriminatory legislation. Burd-Sharps drew a direct line between policy decisions and the safety of marginalized communities, suggesting that legislative action — or inaction — has real, tangible consequences for the lives of transgender individuals.“It’s a combination of weak legislation on hate crimes and the kind of new [anti-LGBTQ+] legislation that state governments are considering and passing that target transgender people for unequal treatment,” Burd-Sharps said. She called for stronger legislative action across the country, advocating for the enactment of hate crime misdemeanor prohibitors and extreme risk (or red flag) laws as critical steps toward mitigating this violence. Such measures would significantly impact the safety of transgender individuals by restricting access to firearms for those with hate crime convictions and allowing for the temporary removal of guns from individuals posing a threat to themselves or others, she said.This toxic mix of discriminatory laws and lax gun regulations creates a perilous environment for transgender individuals, particularly in states like Texas, which lacks prohibitions against firearm possession for individuals with hate crime convictions.“If Texas would adopt a hate crime misdemeanor prohibitor, like half of U.S. states, it would right away make a difference,” Burd-Sharps explained. Such legal measures would prevent individuals convicted of hate crimes from legally owning firearms, a step she views as crucial for reducing violence against transgender people.Related: Gun violence ‘is always going to sit with me:’ Grief, trauma, and the rising threat of firearms in AmericaAddressing the broader societal implications, Burd-Sharps urged a collective understanding and response to gun violence, emphasizing that it affects entire communities, not just the transgender population. “Hate crimes and hateful actions in our communities, no matter who it’s against, affects all of us,” she said, calling for a united front to protect vulnerable groups and foster a safer environment for everyone.The conversation also explored the broader social implications of transgender homicides, with Burd-Sharps emphasizing the role of stigma and discrimination in pushing transgender individuals to the margins of society. This marginalization, she noted, often forces transgender people into vulnerable situations that increase their risk of becoming victims of violence. “One of the root causes is the challenge to finding employment, the challenge to being discriminated against, pushes you towards occupations that can expose you to more risk and higher rates of crime,” she said.These social determinants of health and safety, combined with legislative hostility, create a precarious existence for many transgender people.Burd-Sharps said transgender homicides should matter to everyone, not just those within the LGBTQ+ community. She framed this violence as an issue that impacts entire communities. “We live in communities, we live in neighborhoods, and I’m not just saying that you could take a bullet because you happen to be in proximity of it, but you are part of a community where these crimes are occurring,” she said.From Your Site Articles3 transgender people were slain in just two weeks.

Most emblematic of the news coverage is NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt’s introduction to Morgan Chasky’s report from Houston which, across the dial, was the top story: LESTER HOLT: Good evening, everyone. It has one of the largest congregations in the country. And tonight after the terrifying shooting inside Joel Osteen's Lakewood church in Houston, disturbing clues are emerging about the woman who carried it out. Police say she brought her 7-year-old son inside the church on Sunday between services, and opened fire in the hallway with an AR-15 rifle. Two off-duty officers engaged her in a shootout, ultimately killing her. Her son critically wounded in the head. And police today revealing a sticker on her gun had the word ""Palestine"" on it and that she left behind antisemitic writings along with suspicious chemicals found in her home. None of which law enforcement officials say adds up to a conclusive motive. All three networks ran a variant of this common theme with these same basic points: ‘Joel Osteen’s megachurch’, a recount of events, the intervention of off-duty law enforcement, the ‘Palestine’ sticker on the shooter’s rifle and the antisemitic writings found in her vehicle. Also echoing across all three networks- the shooter’s mental health state. NBC went above and beyond by noting that the shooter was at one time subject to an emergency detention order. But missing from all three reports- the shooter’s trans identity. As our friend Chaya Raichik reported: the shooter, who was born female, was detained multiple times under a male identity. There is no explanation of this whatsoever. The public is simply to accept the narrative of the troubled woman at face value. In fact, many were confused as to what the shooter was- male or female- until the medical examiner weighed in. The “Palestine” sticker and antisemitic writings are explained away as a beef with her ex husband’s family. But even law enforcement stated that it is too early to establish a motive for this shooting. Also an undercovered angle: her migrant status. How was she able to get a firearm? We don’t know. Expect the networks to eject from the story altogether if there is a definitive trans angle that emerges. To view the ABC transcript, click HERE. To view the CBS transcript, click HERE.

Accept News Fox News and GOP politicians falsely claim Lakewood Church shooter was transgender (church) Shutterstock; (mugshot) Texas Department of Public Safety The suspected shooter was a 36-year-old who police identified as the mother of a 7-year-old boy who was shot in the incident.Christopher WigginsFebruary 12 2024 4:14 PM ESTFebruary 13 2024 5:06 PM ESTCwnewserSoon after news broke that a person had entered Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas, on Sunday and opened fire, right-wing influencers, Republican politicians, and right-wing media outlets, including Fox News, pushed a false narrative that the suspected shooter was transgender. Related: No, transgender and nonbinary people are not frequently mass shootersDuring a Monday afternoon press conference, Houston officials, including Police Chief Troy Finner and Democratic Mayor John Whitmire, provided updates on the investigation.The incident, which unfolded just before the church’s Spanish language service on Sunday afternoon, involved a 36-year-old woman opening fire inside the megachurch premises. She was accompanied by a 7-year-old boy, who was critically wounded in the ensuing shootout with police, officials said. A 57-year-old man, not believed to be directly involved in the initial incident, also suffered gunshot wounds but is in stable condition. The shooter was subsequently shot and killed by two off-duty officers working security at the church, authorities confirmed.The shooter was armed with an AR-15 and a 22-caliber rifle, police officials said.“She had a long gun, and it could’ve been a lot worse,” Finner remarked. The chief also addressed the critical condition of the injured child, emphasizing the shooter’s responsibility for endangering the child if the police gunfire had led to his injuries. It’s unclear who shot the child.Whitmire focused on reassurance and the ongoing priority of public safety, stating, “It is our highest priority to have total transparency,” and emphasizing the city’s dedication to addressing mental health issues and ensuring the safety of all places of worship.Commander Christopher Hassig of HPD’s homicide division clarified the shooter's identity.“Our shooter is identified by a driver’s license as Genesee Moreno, 36 years old, Hispanic female,” Hassig said. “She has utilized both male and female names, but through all of our investigation to this point…she has been identified this entire time as female.”Finner later clarified, “It’s the biological mother,” referring to the critically injured 7-year-old boy who was shot in the head.The incident has also been a magnet for misinformation, notably propagated by far-right figures on social media. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, contributed to the confusion with a post on X, formerly Twitter, making unfounded claims about the shooter’s identity and motivations. “Not only was the shooter a trans from El Salvador, she also had a gun engraved with ‘Free Palestine’, but investigators can’t say if she was politically motivated or not. When this country starts being truthful, regardless of who’s feelings get hurt, we will solve many problems,” Greene wrote, casting aspersions without evidence. — (@) Hassig disclosed that the buttstock of the AR-15 the shooter used had a single sticker that read “Palestine.” — (@) Chaya Raichik of Libs of TikTok further fueled the misinformation, erroneously writing, “BREAKING: The Lakewood Church shooter was transgender. He went by the name ‘Genesse’ and previously ‘Jeffrey.’ Another act of trans terrorism. We need to have a national conversation about the LGBTQ movement turning youth into violent extremists,” based solely on the suspect’s criminal history listing a male name as an alias.“There are some discrepancies,” Hassig said, noting, “We do have reports she used multiple aliases, including Jeffrey Escalante,” but that based on police records and interviews, the shooter was identified as female throughout. — (@) Republican Missouri U.S. Senator Josh Hawley also perpetuated the falsehood that the shooter was trans.“So the Lakewood church shooter was a transgender, pro-Palestine radical. We need a full hate crimes investigation, including the influences on the shooter’s motivation, plans & thinking,” he wrote.According to a Reuters fact-check, the vast majority of mass shooters are cisgender white men.So the Lakewood church shooter was a transgender, pro-Palestine radical. We need a full hate crimes investigation, including the influences on the shooter\u2019s motivation, plans & thinking \n\nhttps://t.co/TwFlaQcRfe — (@) Fox News also ran a false story with the headline, “Lakewood church shooting suspect identified as transgender woman; ‘Free Palestine’ written on gun,” before changing it, without adding an editor’s note, to “Lakewood church shooter identified as Genesse Ivonne Moreno; ‘Palstine’ written on gun.” The article’s authors did insert within the body of the piece a sentence that claimed that ‘Preliminary reporting indicated the shooter was transgender,” which is also false.Oh no you don't Fox News, you don't get to make incendiary claims without evidence and then stealth edit your articles without a full retraction and correction. — (@) In response to these misleading narratives, Alejandra Caraballo, a transgender attorney and Harvard Law School instructor, criticized the rush to spread falsehoods.She wrote: “Far right extremist accounts like Libs of Tiktok rushed to call the shooter at Joel Osteen’s church a transgender woman. The police have just confirmed that is not the case and she was the biological mother of the child who was shot. They won’t apologize or retract their lies.”GLAAD's president and CEO Sara Kate Ellis told The Advocate in a statement, ""It is unbelievably tragic and unfortunately all-too predictable to see another community reeling from gun violence, and social media extremists trying to dictate coverage with repulsive and irresponsible lies. Smearing transgender people is inaccurate and harmful, and it distracts from what should be the focus in every mass shooting: the pain in shattered communities, how gun violence is the number one killer of children, and how easy access to weapons of war continues to endanger every community.""She added: ""Social media extremists who obsess over transgender people and new ways to target them are not assignment editors. They are extremists whose disinformation campaigns lead to bomb threats against children's hospitals, elementary schools, libraries and churches. Their lies are dangerous and have consequences. Every reporter and voter must ask their local leaders what they are doing to end gun violence. Every American must reject rhetoric from politicians and extremist media that prioritizes unhinged obsessions over public safety.”From Your Site ArticlesRight-wing influencers seem happy that Iowa school shooter might be LGBTQ+ ›Far-Right Rep.

Gov. Mark Robinson (R) delivers remarks at an event in Washington in June. (Sarah Silbinger for The Washington Post)Listen4 minShareCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveNorth Carolina’s lieutenant governor, a leading candidate in this year’s gubernatorial election, said this month that transgender women who use women’s restrooms “will be arrested” and suggested they instead “find a corner outside somewhere.”Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter.“We’re going to defend women in this state,” Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R) said at a campaign event. “That means if you’re a man on Friday night, and all of a sudden Saturday you feel like a woman and you want to go in the women’s bathroom in the hall, you will be arrested — or whatever we got to do to you.”At another campaign stop that same day, he told the crowd that “if you are confused [about which bathroom to use], find a corner outside somewhere. I’m sorry, we’re not tearing society down because of this.”Robinson’s campaign did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment from The Washington Post.AdvertisementThe remarks, which were received with cheers and laughter, drew comparisons to the infamous “bathroom bill” North Carolina lawmakers passed in 2016. Polls suggest Robinson is the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for governor in a state where national controversy erupted over legislation requiring transgender people to use public bathrooms matching the gender on their birth certificates.Robinson was catapulted into the spotlight in 2018, when he spoke about gun rights during a town-hall-style meeting of the Greensboro City Council. His speech was shared by a North Carolina state representative and went viral. He was elected North Carolina’s first Black lieutenant governor in 2020, and in April 2023 announced he was running for governor.Former president Donald Trump endorsed Robinson in June, and polls indicate he’s ahead of his two GOP rivals competing for the nomination. (Incumbent Gov. Roy Cooper (D) is term-limited and unable to seek reelection; five Democrats are seeking their party’s nomination.)AdvertisementRobinson’s comments on the campaign trail this month are the most recent in a controversial record that stretches back years. He called the Holocaust “hogwash” in a past Facebook post that he later said was “poorly worded,” WRAL reported. In June 2021, Robinson called the LGBTQ community “filth.” When video of the comments surfaced in October of that year, North Carolina Democrats pressed him to resign, one calling him a “disgrace” and “an embarrassment” to the state. Robinson rebuffed the pressure, saying that he was referring to sexually explicit LGBTQ books he claimed were circulating in North Carolina public schools.Share this articleShareRobinson entered the political arena in the aftermath of the demise of House Bill 2, the so-called bathroom bill. After a year of fierce blowback that included economic boycotts, job losses and public criticism, lawmakers repealed the law in a deal that prohibited local governments from passing measures to protect LGBTQ people.Since then, gender identity and transgender rights have only grown as a political flash point in the culture wars, becoming favorite targets of conservatives at a national level. Between 2018 and 2022, the number of anti-trans laws across the country skyrocketed.AdvertisementAlex Baltzegar, a spokesman for Bill Graham, one of the candidates competing against Robinson for the GOP nomination, told The Post that Robinson’s “demeaning comments” about women will not only hobble Republicans’ chances to take over the state’s executive branch but also their efforts to rally support for the party’s eventual presidential nominee.“His comments about the Holocaust being hogwash along with his demeaning comments about women will wreck GOP chances for regaining the White House and the governorship here in North Carolina,” Baltzegar said.Robinson’s other Republican rival, State Treasurer Dale Folwell, told The Post that he believes “that only girls should be in girls bathrooms” but criticized Robinson for what he described as fearmongering to enrage people and whip up votes.“Mark Robinson is history’s latest example of someone trying to rise to power through hate,” he said.Share CommentsSign upTOP STORIESTechnologyBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devicesElon Musk claims driver in 2022 Tesla crash did not have Full Self-DrivingSpaceX launches a commercial lander to the moon in historic missionSenate poised to pass biggest piece of tech regulation in decadesTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com © 1996-2024 The Washington Post "

Mark Robinson suggested transgender women ""find a corner"" to use as a bathroom instead.By Sara BoboltzReporter, HuffPostFeb 13, 2024, 12:10 PM ESTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGA leading gubernatorial candidate in North Carolina said earlier this month that transgender women who need to use a public bathroom of their choosing should “find a corner outside somewhere” or else be arrested.North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R) has a history of transphobic, racist and antisemitic comments, leading the Charlotte Observer’s editorial board to once call him an “embarrassment.” Advertisement Robinson hammered his point on transgender rights during at least two campaign stops earlier this month.“We’re going to defend women in this state,” he said at one, as The Washington Post was first to report.“That means if you’re a man on Friday night, and all of a sudden Saturday you feel like a woman and you want to go in the women’s bathroom in the hall, you will be arrested, or whatever we got to do to you. We’re going to protect our women,” he said. The audience cheered for his remarks. At another stop, Robinson made audience members laugh by saying, “If you are confused, find a corner outside somewhere.”Advertisement He added: “I’m sorry, we are not tearing society down because of this.”Polls indicate that Robinson is the leading GOP contender for North Carolina governor; the state’s primary is scheduled for March 5. If selected, he will likely go up against Democratic candidate Josh Stein. Robinson has served as second-in-command to North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) since 2021. On social media, Robinson has made comments questioning the reality of the Holocaust. He suggested that the film “Black Panther” was “created by an agnostic Jew and put to film by a satanic marxist” in order “to pull the shekels out of your Schvartze pockets,” using a Yiddish word for Black people. He has repeatedly denounced transgender rights, saying that people “who support this mass delusion called transgenderism” were trying “to turn God’s creation backwards.”When asked about his controversial remarks in 2020, Robinson said he stood by them.The North Carolina legislature has over the past several years passed bills attacking transgender rights, overriding Cooper’s vetoes.

Governor Mark Robinson, currently the leading candidate for the GOP nomination for governor, launched an attack on transgender women years after the Tar Heel State's last GOP governor cost the state millions – and possibly billions – of dollars, and cost him his political career over the very same issue.“We're going to defend women in this state,” vowed Robinson, according to WUNC, at a campaign stop earlier this month. “That means if you're a man on Friday night, and all the sudden on Saturday, you feel like a woman, and you want to go in the women's bathroom in the mall, you will be arrested — or whatever we got to do to you.”""In campaign speeches in recent weeks,"" WUNC added, ""Robinson suggested that people who previously identified as male should be 'arrested' if they go in a women’s bathroom. Instead, he suggests they should 'find a corner outside somewhere' to relieve themselves.""RELATED: Watch: Bigoted NC Lt. Gov.

Mark Robinson comments House Bill 2By Laura Leslie , WRAL capitol bureau chiefWith the primary election just three weeks away, Republican gubernatorial front-runner Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is campaigning on the issue of transgender people and restrooms.""If you're a man on Friday night,"" Robinson told a crowd of supporters at a recent event in Cary, ""and all the sudden on Saturday you feel like a woman, and you want to go in the women's bathroom in the mall, you will be arrested — or whatever we got to do to you. We got to protect our women.""That's an echo of a 2016 bill that regulated which restrooms transgender people could use. The bill, known as HB2, provoked a tremendous international backlash, including a boycott that cost the state billions of dollars in lost investments, jobs and events, before the law was partially repealed the next year.N.C. State political scientist Steven Greene doesn’t think state lawmakers are likely to want to revisit that issue in an election year.""It’s bad politics,"" Greene told WRAL News. ""Arguably, this could help him win the Republican primary, but he already seems in a strong position there. And looking at the general election, running as a right-wing culture warrior is not a recipe for winning statewide election as governor in North Carolina.""Robinson's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment. Republican legislative leaders also didn't respond to inquiries about revisiting HB2.Meredith College political scientist David McLennan says it’s the latest example in Robinson’s long track record of anti-LGBTQ statements. He said it's probably good for Robinson's fundraising, but may not sit well with voters in November if Robinson wins his party's nomination in the primary.""When he talks about dehumanizing people and making them unable to use bathrooms, that may be too far for the average voter who might even be center-right on this particular issue,"" McLennan said.""He's provocative, and that gets him a lot of airtime,"" McLennan added. ""But on the other hand, he's going to be somewhat like Donald Trump — he's probably the greatest turnout machine that the Democrats can hope for.""Robinson's Republican primary opponents criticized Robinson's comments.“Mark Robinson is history's latest example of someone rising to power through hate,” said State Treasurer Dale Folwell, who is also seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination.Bill Graham, a Salisbury lawyer is also seeking the nomination. ""Mark Robinson is going to lose, and he will hurt all Republican candidates up and down the ballot if he's the nominee,"" said Alex Baltzegar, a spokesman for Graham.relatedNCCapitolWRAL specialistsMark Robinsonelections2024 electionsTrending NC State's Corrigan signs contract extension worth more than $1.4M annually 'Malcolm in the Middle' star Frankie Muniz back at Daytona and rising up the NASCAR racing ladder Madison Hayes scores 16, tight defense helps No. 6 NC State beat No. 16 Notre Dame 59-43 First PWHL trade stuns and reminds women's hockey players about reality of professional ranks51 MINS AGO All ACC teams won't compete at 2025 conference basketball tournamentsVideos watch · 31:42WRAL Late News watch · 2:43WRAL WeatherCenter Forecast watch · 36:15Donald Trump ordered to pay more than $300 million in civil case watch · 1:21Daytime Pick 3 and Pick 4 Drawing watch · 5:56Sky 5 flies over a police scene•CreditsLaura LeslieReporterMark BerginWeb EditorRaleighDurhamFayettevilleAbout UsPeople of WRALCareersContestsHelpContact UsWays to Reach UsSend tips, photos or videosSubmit a correctionAdvertise with UsYour News, DeliveredNewsletters & AlertsOur AppsTV ListingsFollow WRAL NewsTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesRaleigh EEOWilmington EEOEFF Public FileFCC ApplicationsClosed Captioning©2023 Capitol Broadcasting Company, Inc."

Gov. Mark Robinson, who has called LGBTQ+ people ""filth"" and ""maggots.""Alex CooperFebruary 10 2024 1:38 PM ESTFebruary 10 2024 6:12 PM EST@wgacooperNorth Carolina Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson seems to want to ban transgender people from using the bathroom that most aligns with their gender identity. Yes, the same kind of “bathroom bill” that failed almost seven years ago.In recent remarks as Robinson campaigns to be the state’s next governor, he’s said that transgender women should be “arrested” for using women’s bathrooms. He’s also said that instead of using the women’s bathroom, trans women should “find a corner outside somewhere.”“We're going to defend women in this state,” the GOP politician said in a video filmed at a campaign event this month. “That means if you're a man on Friday night, and all the sudden on Saturday, you feel like a woman, and you want to go in the women's bathroom in the mall, you will be arrested — or whatever we got to do to you.”Mark Robinson - We Will Arrest People For Using The Bathroom They Choosewww.youtube.comIn another speech, Robinson said, “if you are confused, find a corner outside somewhere to go. We're not tearing society down because of this.”Mark Robinson on Bathroomswww.youtube.comRobinson’s opponents for the Republican nomination for governor haven’t addressed or condemned his anti-trans comments, but have called him out for his other bigoted remarks.“Mark Robinson will lose and hurt all GOP candidates if he is the nominee,” candidate Bill Graham’s spokesman Alex Baltzegar said in an email to North Carolina public radio station WUNC. “His comments about the Holocaust being hogwash along with his demeaning comments about women will wreck GOP chances for regaining the White House and the governorship here in North Carolina.”The station reports that Graham’s campaign launched new campaign ads and a website, meetmarkrobinson.com, which focus on Robinson’s incendiary comments. The outlet notes that the ads leave out his anti-LGBTQ+ statements.State Treasurer Dale Folwell, another GOP lawmaker running for governor, echoed Robinson’s transphobia. He said, “women should be in women’s bathrooms only, and if the General Assembly thinks those laws need to be tightened, then that’s something they should work on ... I just think there are so many laws that people need to make sure are actually being enforced,” according to the radio station.“He’s history’s latest example of someone who’s trying to rise to power based on telling people who to hate,” Folwell added.Keep up with the latest in LGBTQ+ news and politics. Sign up for The Advocate's email newsletter.Robinson has a history of making gross anti-LGBTQ+ comments.Speaking at a North Carolina church in June 2021, he said, “There’s no reason anybody anywhere in America should be telling any child about transgenderism, homosexuality, any of that filth.”He added, “And yes, I called it filth, and if you don’t like that I called it filth, come see me and I’ll explain it to you.”In November of that year, in another church appearance, he said straight couples are superior to same-sex ones because they can potentially reproduce sexually. He equated LGBTQ+ people with “what the cows leave behind” as well as “maggots” and “flies.”From Your Site ArticlesNorth Carolina's Virulently Anti-LGBTQ+ Lt. Gov.

He won awards for his performances as he moved up in his career to become an administrator. He never had a problem with his dual identities, he said, until last year.At the start of the fall 2023 semester, as Murnan started a new job as principal of John Glenn Elementary School in the Western Heights School District, an anonymous newsletter posted about his drag persona and past criminal charges he had faced. Two days later, on Aug. 31, the far-right social media account Libs of TikTok posted about Murnan, and Ryan Walters, the incendiary state superintendent, called for him to be fired. Soon after, the district and Murnan received bomb threats, according to police records and interviews.Now Murnan is leaving his job, while Walters tries to enact rules to make it easier to fire educators who perform in drag outside of their jobs. Murnan said he most likely won’t work for another school district in Oklahoma after this experience.“I’m a very professional person — I’ve worked really hard,” Murnan said in an interview. “I’ve gone to school. I got my bachelor’s, my master’s, my doctorate — I have been devoted to education, trying to make it a better thing. But they’ve destroyed me, and I don’t know where I’m going or what I’m doing now. This has been a nightmare.”The Western Heights School Board voted Monday to accept Murnan’s resignation at its regular monthly meeting. Murnan said district administrators had not allowed him to work in the John Glenn Elementary School building during the school day since September because they said it was a safety risk. While Western Heights Superintendent Brayden Savage initially backed Murnan, he said, she told him last month that if he didn’t resign, the district would terminate him because of the cost of increased security. The district asked him to sign an agreement that included a clause preventing him from talking publicly about the controversy, Murnan said, but he refused. Savage didn’t respond to a request for comment. Murnan is the latest example of an educator singled out by Walters over ideological disagreements. Walters accused a teacher in 2022 of promoting pornography by sharing a QR code to access books from the Brooklyn Public Library; the teacher quit and moved out of the state as Walters moved to revoke her teaching license. Last August, Walters promoted a Libs of TikTok post about an Oklahoma school librarian — who said her “radical liberal agenda is teaching kids to love books and be kind” — and suggested it showed a “woke ideology”; the librarian’s district for several days received bomb threats, which were deemed not credible.Ryan Walters, Oklahoma's schools superintendent, warned that people who hired Shane Murnan will be ""held accountable.""Christopher Creese for NBC NewsReacting to earlier reports about Murnan’s exit, Walters posted a video on Feb. 2 calling his resignation “a big win for Oklahoma schools.” He promised that people who hired him “will be held accountable.” The Oklahoma Education Department declined to answer several questions regarding Walters’ statements about Murnan and Western Heights, but Walters said in a statement he has “proposed the most aggressive model in the nation for identifying and uprooting these folks from our schools.”Walters recently proposed a regulation that would allow educators to be fired for “acts that excessively promote sexuality” outside of work “in the presence of a minor or in a manner available to a minor online.” He has said the proposed rule, which is still being considered by the state agency, is an attempt to prevent others who perform in drag from holding positions as teachers or administrators, and the department has stated it assumes such educators are “likely to behave inappropriately in the presence of minors in a classroom.”The anonymous newsletter that first called attention to Murnan, called V1SUT, has also frequently focused on decades-old criminal charges against Murnan that were dropped.Murnan was charged with possession of child sexual abuse material in 2001, when he was a fifth grade teacher. Two judges dismissed the charges, ruling that prosecutors couldn’t prove the allegations, and the cases were expunged. Murnan contends a former colleague fabricated the allegations.Before Western Heights hired him as a principal, Murnan passed a background check, and the district said it was aware of his past court cases. The district has said he came highly recommended, and it noted his teaching certificate had recently been reissued to him, signed by Walters. Community members rallied in September to defend Murnan. They showed up at the school board meeting with shirts reading “#StandWithMurnan.” Murnan said he didn’t hide his side gig as a drag queen, but he also didn’t boast about it at school.“There’s never been an issue, because I’ve never put it out there to make it an issue,” he said. “I did my side job on the weekends, and then I went to work and worked my tail off to make the school a better place. They never conflicted with each other. Then someone took it and ran with it and tried to make it into a spectacle that it’s not.”Savage, the district superintendent, told John Glenn Elementary School staff members at a Dec. 15 meeting that she had defended Murnan, according to video of the meeting obtained by NBC News. However, Savage told the employees that Murnan wouldn’t return to the elementary school campus because she and the district were still receiving hate mail and threats.“I’m not caving to Ryan Walters,” Savage told the staff, “but I have to ultimately keep the students and the staff of this school safe. The hate has not stopped. To bring Shane back to the building is a risk to safety for all. I cannot be totally sure that one of those crazies will not show up to, quote-unquote, cleanse the building, which is something I’ve seen over and over again.”In January, Murnan said, the district unexpectedly put him on administrative leave. Savage then asked him to resign, citing the expense of extra security, Murnan said. Savage told The Oklahoman the district had spent about $65,000 since August on additional security, administrative help, and other costs. Murnan said he signed a resignation letter on Jan. 26. Murnan said his ouster raises questions about the state education department’s focus.“Right now, it’s not about the kids in Oklahoma,” Murnan said. “It’s all about politics.”Tyler KingkadeTyler Kingkade is a national reporter for NBC News, based in Los Angeles.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL"

Kim Reynolds introduced the controversial bill earlier this month. The legislation would add new definitions of man and woman to state law, as well as require changes to birth certificates and government collection of data.The bill has drawn widespread condemnation from LGBTQ+ rights advocacy groups, who branded it as ""erasure"" of transgender and nonbinary people and a violation of privacy.Republicans fast-tracked Reynolds' proposal last week, advancing it through subcommittee and committee hearings over the course of an afternoon over the objections of Democrats and advocates.More:Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds' bill defining a 'man' and a 'woman,' explained in 75 secondsHeated testimony at hearing comes amid raucous chants outsideReynolds has described the legislation as a ""women's bill of rights,"" while opponents say it would not only harm LGBTQ Iowans but could impact other services, like aid for sexual assault and domestic abuse victims.Denise Bubeck, deputy director of The Family Leader's Church Ambassador Network, said she was thankful that Reynolds brought the bill forward.""It is legislation based on biological truth,"" she said. ""Actually, none of us would be here today if it wasn’t for biology. God created woman and man. Period.""Max Mowitz described themselves as a proud Iowan. The legislation will likely cause many LGBTQ Iowans to leave the state, Mowitz said, ""but I cannot bring myself to do the same.""""Being an Iowan is just as important to me as being trans,"" Mowitz said. ""This is my state, too. Every time I come to this Capitol, I am reminded of how much I love a state that does not love me back.""The atmosphere in the room grew tense at times, with one speaker describing transgender women in women's bathroom as engaging in ""domestic terrorism"" and another likening being transgender to joining a cult.Rep. Skyler Wheeler, R-Hull, who ran the hearing, stopped the speakers several times throughout the night as chants of ""you will not erase us"" echoed through the frosted glass doors of the committee room.""We’re going to hold off until that stops,"" he said at one point. ""I know when you’re in here you can probably hear fine, but as I said earlier we’re not going to have a heckler’s veto.""Acting on signals from those standing just outside the committee room's doors, the crowd began chanting while proponents of the legislation spoke inside.When the crowd got word that Wheeler was pausing, they initially quieted down before breaking into another chant in response: ""we won't play your game, that's not why we came.""During the hearing, others gathered in the hallway strained to hear testimony, holding their phones to their ears with a live stream pulled up. When it came to a close, chants were amplified as the room emptied and some of those who were in the room joined the rotunda crowd.""We'll keep showing up,"" they chanted before dispersing, also shouting expletives directed at Reynolds.Berry Stevens, a genderfluid 13-year-old, said the law attempts to write them out of existence and would endanger LGBTQ Iowans.""Because you seem to need a reminder, gender is how we present ourselves to the world and sex is based on anatomical genetic and chromosomal details,"" Stevens said. ""You can know my gender based on how I present and introduce myself, however you can’t know my sex without accessing my medical records, genetic testing or you being a creep.""Josh Briggs, a father of four girls, said it was ""ridiculous"" that the legislation was needed. But he said opponents of the bill ""forced the need for this legislation through their totalitarian tactics.""""It does not take a biologist to understand that males and females are different, not just in sexual organs, but size, shape, respiratory systems, skin, hair, nervous systems, brain, sensory immune systems, tissues,"" he said. ""The science is truly clear.""More:What you should know about the Iowa bill that legally defines 'man,' 'woman' and 'sex'Reynolds' bill would define sex, female, male, woman, girl, man, boy, father and mother in state law, and require new birth certificates for transgender Iowans to include the sex assigned at birth and current identity, after the state registrar receives a notarized affidavit from a licensed physician or surgeon stating the reason for surgery and the person's changed sex designation.During committee, Republicans amended the bill to remove language that would require transgender Iowans to get a new marking on their driver's license to identify their sex assigned at birth and current identity.Several speakers took issue with a line in the bill that says ""'equal' does not mean 'same' or 'identical,'"" and that ""separate accommodations are not inherently unequal.""""I am confused why we are here discussing the concept of separate but equal and how our governor believes this bill is constitutional we all know separate but equal is inherently unconstitutional,"" said Annie Sarcone, director of the Des Moines Queer Youth Resource Center.Geralyn Jones, a mother from Linn County, said it's simple to define a woman's biological makeup.""I find it insulting that we have legislators and school board members and others in positions of authority that find it challenging to define what a female is,"" she said. ""That’s unacceptable. You’re supposed to be standing on truth.""Galen Bacharier covers politics for the Register.

Unsplash, Scott Roberson Update - 4:45 pm Eastern: During a Monday afternoon press conference, Christopher Hassig, commander of the HPD homicide unit, addressed the confusion regarding the shooter's identity, specifically gender. Per Hassig: Advertisement ""Our shooter is identified by a driver's license as Genesse Moreno, 36 years old, Hispanic female. There are some discrepancies — we do have reports she used multiple aliases, including ""Jeffrey Escalante,"" so she has utilized both male and female names. But through all of our investigation to this point, talking with individuals, interviews, documents, Houston Police Department reports she has been identified this entire time as female — she/her. And so we are identifying her as Genesse Moreno, Hispanic female.""The child has been identified as Moreno's seven-year-old biological son. He sustained one gunshot wound to the head and is in critical condition.Additionally, authorities provided some clarification regarding the reported writing/sticker on the weapon. Authorities stated that the buttstock of the AR-15 she wielded featured a sticker of the word ""Palestine."" Previous reports incorrectly stated the long gun featured the words ""Free Palestine."" Hassig stated ""antisemitic writings"" have been discovered in subsequent investigations into Genesse.Authorities also provided some additional background that may point to a potential motive.Hassig also stated the shooter had a history of mental health illness and was previously put under emergency detention orders by Houston police. Genesse appears to have legally purchased at least one of the guns used in the attack as recently as December. The commander stated the shooter may have been embroiled in a familial dispute with the family of an ex-husband.""We do believe there was a familial dispute between her and her ex-husband's family, and some of those people are Jewish,"" Hassig said. Advertisement Original StorySunday, 36-year-old Genesse Ivonne Moreno, accompanied by a five-year-old child, walked into Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church in Houston and opened fire with an AR-15-style modern sporting rifle, wounding a 57-year-old man before being killed by security guards. The child was wounded and is hospitalized.ALERT: Houston Police Confirm Shooter Dead, 2 Injured After Gunfire at Osteen Church During ServiceA larger tragedy was avoided by Lakewood Church having armed security guards who were doing their job diligently and a plan for the possibility of an active shooter.As the facts dripped out, it became evident that this shooting would be quickly memory-holed. The shooter was a ""transwoman"" whose real name was Jeffrey Escalante. Escalante was from El Salvador, but there is no word on his immigration status. Per law enforcement records, Moreno also had identified as Jeffery Escalante in the past, and had prior arrests for assault, forgery, marijuana possession, theft, evading, and unlawful carrying weapon— Jeremy Rogalski (@JRogalskiKHOU) February 12, 2024The AR-15 he carried had ""Free Palestine"" written on it. As one of my colleagues noted, someone with a rifle with ""Free Palestine"" scrawled on it using a child as a human shield is just about as on-brand as you can get. Advertisement As I've noted before, the trans movement has a very dark and violent undertone.In the past four years, there has been a surge in the number of mass shootings carried out by transgender or related murderers. In addition to Hale, we have:Colorado Springs, CO, nightclub shooting (Attorney: Suspected Colorado Mass Shooter Identifies as ‘Non-Binary’), November 2022, Anderson Aldrich (Nicholas Brink), “non-binary.”Denver, CO, school shooting (Father of Colorado High School Shooting Suspect is an Illegal Immigrant Deported Twice, Charged with Very Serious Crimes), May 2019, Maya “Alec” McKinney, transgender female-to-male.Aberdeen, MD, workplace shooting (Last Week There Was a Mass Shooting at a Maryland Industrial Park but No One Seems to Care), September 2018, Snochia Moseley, transgender female-to-male.Three things come to mind. First, considering the number of people legitimately identifying as transgender — by that, I mean people who aren’t using transgender as a scam to see naked girls and women — is very small; they are disproportionately represented. Second, they are of the female-to-male variety. Third, the shootings run in tandem with the violent imagery and rhetoric used by transgenders and their supporters.We need to wake up to what is going on. People already suffering from a mental disorder and who may be on a hormonal drug regimen are becoming radicalized and encouraged to use violence to address their grievances with the rest of the world. The political side of the transgender movement is not benign; that movement openly promotes violence, and until it is treated as the public safety threat that it is, we’d better get used to more Nashvilles.

They gathered on central Syntagma Square, waving Greek flags and brandishing crosses anxd banners opposing same-sex parenthood.“Hands off the children,” chanted the crowd, which featured several robed priests and supporters of the far-right party Niki, whose leader Dimitris Natsios was present.The Orthodox Church of Greece — which has close ties to many government MPs — has said it is “totally opposed” to the reform, arguing that it “condemns” children to grow up in an “environment of confusion”.Protester Efrosini, an Athens pensioner, said same-sex couples already have rights under a civil union reform adopted in 2015.Even Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who is personally championing the Bill, has stressed that the changes would benefit just “a few children and couples”.The Bill is expected to split Mitsotakis’ conservative New Democracy, with dozens of the party’s 158 lawmakers likely to oppose it or abstain.However, it is likely to pass with the support of the main opposition Syriza party, whose leader Stefanos Kasselakis is gay, the socialist Pasok party and other smaller parties.

The bill is set for a vote in parliament in days.Greece’s conservative government is sponsoring the bill but it will require votes from center and left opposition parties to be approved. However, even some center-left lawmakers have gone on record as opposing the bill. Organizers of Sunday’s rally — religious groups — described the bill as a threat to the traditional family. Many of the protesters chanted “hands off our children.” “Unfortunately, the woke agenda has also reached Greece and that agenda includes the marriage of homosexuals,” Dimitris Natsios, leader of the far-right and strongly religious Niki party told the Associated Press.

Maria Childres, 25, allegedly bragged to co-workers at the Explore Learning Academy in Paducah, Ky., about two hours north of Nashville, that the child “liked” the November 2022 abuse. An anonymous tipster apparently told authorities that they saw Childres, who was born a biological male named Mark, rub the child’s genitals in a “circular motion” and that the baby appeared to be in distress, according to court records obtained by the Reduxx news site. The colleague had asked Childres for help changing the infant’s diaper and Childres allegedly told her fellow employee, “that was her clit area and she likes it. It just made her day.” The day care director had apparently been aware of Childres’ behavior with the baby but had only given her a “write-up,” police discovered when they went to the facility, WPDS-TV reported last year. Transgender woman Maria Childres escaped jail time and may avoid a criminal record in exchange for a plea deal despite sexually abusing a baby. McCracken County Jail When questioned by police, Childres at first denied she changed the baby’s diaper but later admitted doing so after being shown texts between herself and the day care bosses, according to reports. Reduxx obtained court records detailing the full complaint against Childers, revealing that she was accused of both physical and sexual abuse while working at the day care center. Cops later discovered Childers had also been accused by other co-workers of leaving the children in high chairs for “hours” without care. Under questioning, Childres tried to deny having ever said anything inappropriate, but admitted she often said things that were “taken out of context.” Judge Joseph Roark sentenced Maria Childres to a 12-month penalty, but withheld jail time and given a conditional discharge for six months. If she abides by the conditions, she may not face any jail time at all. Linkedin/Joseph Roark Childers was arrested and charged with one count of first-degree sexual abuse of a victim under 12, and three counts of first degree criminal abuse of a child. Court records show that just one month after being booked into jail on the felony charges, Childers privately retained trans activist lawyer Madison Leach to represent her, and the crime was later reduced to a misdemeanor by Judge Joseph Roark. Childres was incarcerated from February 8, 2023 through January 26, 2024. The crime was later reduced to a misdemeanor by Judge Joseph Roark but Roark told The Post that prosecutors recommended the charges be reduced to a misdemeanor and he merely went along with their recommendation. Judge Roark gave Childres a 12-month penalty, but withheld sentencing and imposed a conditional discharge for six months.

(Photo via: McCracken County Jail – Kentucky) OAN’s Brooke Mallory3:29 PM – Thursday, February 8, 2024 A biological man that now identifies as a transgender woman who was accused of sexually assaulting an infant entered into a plea agreement, and if he continues to comply with the terms of the agreement, will not go to prison in Kentucky. Advertisement Former childcare worker “Maria Childers” enlisted the help of a well-known trans activist attorney to defend him in the horrifying case. Following an anonymous complaint to the Department of Community Based Services (DCBS) regarding purported abuse at Explore Learning Academy that was first reported in November 2022. Childers was finally placed under arrest in February 2023 after a thorough investigation. According to the tip, which was allegedly submitted by one of Childers’ coworkers, he was accused of inappropriately touching the baby’s private parts and making inappropriate comments while it was being changed on a changing table. Now that the press has been given access to the complete complaint against Childers this week, it shows that he was accused of both physical and sexual abuse during his tenure working at the daycare facility. On February 8th, 2023, a DCBS case worker and a Paducah Police Department officer visited the daycare to speak with witnesses after receiving the first anonymous complaint. They were then able to verify the anonymous allegation by chatting with numerous employees who had also witnessed Childers’ disturbing behavior. Witness testimony said that Childers was asked to help a coworker change an infant’s diaper. The coworker noted that the baby seemed distressed as Childers was cleaning the baby’s genitalia and inquired as to whether Childers was injuring the child. She then saw Childers “circularly” stroke the baby’s genitalia, stating, “That was her clit area, and she likes it. It just made her day.” However, Childers only received a “write up” from Academy management despite being reported. Subsequently, the police discovered that Childers had also been accused by other colleagues of neglecting the kids in high chairs for “hours.” Upon being brought to the police station for interrogation, Childers first claimed that he had not changed the baby’s diaper whatsoever. Nevertheless, after an officer showed him a text message that he had sent to the director of the daycare verifying the baby’s diaper change, he subsequently acknowledged having done so. Later, Childers attempted to refute any inappropriate remarks that he had made and maintained that he frequently made statements that were “taken out of context,” in his own words. Soon after, Childers was taken into custody and charged with three counts of first-degree criminal abuse of a child under the age of twelve and one count of first-degree sexual abuse of a victim under the age of twelve. The McCracken County Jail then received a booking for him. His last name has been spelled differently by the courts, the police, and his social media accounts, which alternate between the spellings “Childers” and “Childres.” This has caused considerable confusion. His name is written “Childres” in the Kentucky Court of Justice records, while “Childers” appears under his own signature and in his defense files. Although Childers was first identified as “male” by the police and the jail, internal records that the outlet Reduxx was able to obtain show that the McCracken County Jail eventually changed Childers’ reported sex to “female.” Court documents also revealed that Childers hired trans activist attorney Madison Leach on a private basis to represent him barely one month after he was detained. When Leach campaigned as a Democrat for the Calloway County attorney seat, he became the first openly transgender candidate to run for public office in western Kentucky. Leach is a biological man who started identifying as a transgender woman seven years ago. Leach filed a request to lower Childers’ bond, claiming that when he was held in solitary confinement at the McCracken County Jail, he was “deprived of estrogen.” The request was eventually granted, and Childers’ bond was lowered from $100,000 to $5,000. The bail requirements included staying away from the daycare where he had worked and having no contact with minors. In January 2024, Childers was freed from detention. Childers seems to have reached an agreement with prosecutors on January 29th, 2024. His charge of First-Degree Sexual Abuse of a Victim Under 12 was modified to Class A Misdemeanor Sexual Misconduct in return for a guilty plea, and the other abuse counts were shockingly withdrawn. Judge Joseph Roark handed Childers “a 12-month penalty,” but deferred sentencing and granted a six-month conditional release. Childers may even avoid having a criminal record and avoid doing any prison time as long as he follows the rules established by the court throughout the six-month term. Kentucky transgender daycare worker ""Maria Childers"" will NOT be going to prison despite pleading guilty to sexually abusing a baby while changing its diaper. He hired a trans activist lawyer, who argued that he would not have access to estrogen, and the court agreed.

Horrifying: ‘Transwoman’ Child Abuser Who Molested a BABY Gets Plea Deal With Zero Jail Time Grateful Calvin | 5:30 PM on February 08, 2024 Advertisement AngieArtist We get told all the time by the trans rights activists (TRAs) that trans people are not child abusers and it’s true that a great many of them likely are not. But then the TRAs try to tell us that transwomen violating children is something that 'never happens.’ Advertisement For something that never happens, it sure does seem to happen a lot. Leaving aside for the moment the horrible grooming that goes on at ‘family friendly’ drag shows, the number of incidences of transgenders being caught in molestation crimes seems to be on the rise. Rapidly. Just yesterday, we learned of a trans TikTok star in Australia pleading guilty to child abuse offenses. Today, there was even worse news out of Kentucky. A transwoman (a.k.a., a man in a dress) who worked at a daycare center – A DAYCARE CENTER – not only pled guilty to molesting an infant, but even worse, he and his TRA attorney negotiated a plea deal that included no jail time. None. Zero. We simply have no words. 🚨EXCLUSIVE🚨A trans-identified male in Kentucky will not be sent to prison despite pleading guilty to sexually abusing a baby while working at a daycare.Maria Childers struck a plea deal after hiring a trans activist lawyer to represent him.https://t.co/TudybPfam6— REDUXX (@ReduxxMag) February 7, 2024REDUXX, who broke the story today, provided more details: A trans-identified male in Kentucky has reached a plea deal after being charged with sexually abusing a baby and will avoid prison so long as he meets certain conditions. Maria Childers, a former daycare worker, hired a prominent trans activist lawyer to represent him in the sickening case. As previously reported by Reduxx, Childers was arrested in February of 2023 after the Department of Community Based Services (DCBS) received an anonymous tip detailing an alleged incident of abuse that had occurred in November of 2022 at Explore Learning Academy. The tip, reportedly written by one of Childers’ co-workers, accused him of making inappropriate comments towards an infant while changing the child’s diaper, and touching the baby inappropriately. Recommended East Palestine, OH Rolls Out the (Un)Welcome Wagon for Biden's 'Friday News Dump'-Style Visit Doug P. Advertisement The story gets way worse. You can read the details in the article, but we prefer not to repeat them here. Instead, we will skip forward to the inexcusable plea deal. (By the way, Childers’ name is not ‘Maria.’ It is Mark. Accuracy matters.) Childers’ attorney, 'Madison Leach’ (another man pretending to be a woman) made a motion to have Childers released from the McCracken County Jail on the following basis: he was not receiving his estrogen in solitary confinement. You simply cannot make this level of depravity up.And the motion was granted. The only conditions of Childers' release are that he wear an ankle monitor, not be around children, and stay in touch with this attorney. Moreover, his felony charge was dismissed and reduced to a misdemeanor charge. If you ask us, that seems like pretty light punishment for molesting babies while changing their diapers. We have other punishments in mind. We probably should not repeat them in polite company ... but we'll let others say it. All convicted child sex offenders, pedos, and groomers should be executed. https://t.co/k1Rpuk6sSO— Steve Deace (@SteveDeaceShow) February 7, 2024REDUXX (and Riley Gaines) even indicated on Twitter that, given the reduction in charges it is probable that Childers will not even be required to register as a sex offender. Do yall realize this means he likely won't even have to register as a sex offender??? He pled guilty to 4 counts of sexual/physical abuse of infants and he walks away with no consequences...This has always been about normalizing pedophilia. https://t.co/MlNe10jLs5— Riley Gaines (@Riley_Gaines_) February 8, 2024 Advertisement How do you not go to jail for admitting to sexually abusing a baby?If you are an illegal alien or a trans person you are never held responsible. - EVERDisgusting! https://t.co/AWiPi0z0Fn— Chris Loesch 𝕏 (@ChrisLoesch) February 7, 2024Disgusting doesn't even begin to describe it.

I couldn't read further.😢 How the hell does this disgusting person NOT get jail time??!!! Any system NOT punishing abuse of a baby is a broken, crooked, useless system!🤬 https://t.co/v7FRuLwRLU— Stacy D (@StacyDmomof5) February 7, 2024There's a reason we didn't repeat all the details of his offense here. We could barely make it through the details ourselves. Hey @LeaderMcConnell @SenRandPaul @RepJamesComer @RepGuthrie @RepThomasMassie @RepHalRogers @RepAndyBarr @RepMcGarveyWhy is a man who sexually abused an infant allowed to walk free in your state? https://t.co/60BSg5cgdI— Amy 🇺🇸 ♀ (@amy_likes_owls) February 7, 2024It is a very good question for our elected leaders. And even though we know what he will say, Governor Andy Beshear needs to be asked this question as well.Reminder that virtually all MTFs are perverts. At best, they're addicted to weirdo pornography and, at worst: https://t.co/epFP8XIOLP— America's Most Vaunted (@AmericaVaunted) February 8, 2024 Advertisement We're done conceding any ground to the TRAs. We're not sure how many it is, but the number is WAY higher than what they try to pawn off as the truth. He sexually abused a baby.

Transgender pedophiles who sexually assault babies get no jail time.Meanwhile, people who pray outside abortion clinics get thrown in the slammer.People seem to be spending a lot of passing judgment on those who came before us.Those same people need to start asking… https://t.co/gKOk88LWoW— David Giglio (@DavidGiglioCA) February 8, 2024I’m facing prison time for being at the Capitol on January 6th while Biden supporters rape babies and get no punishment for it. https://t.co/ShPuiJ2SEG— Philip Anderson (@VoteBidenOut) February 8, 2024Saying that there's a 'two-tiered' justice system isn't really accurate anymore. There appears to be, in fact, NO justice system, just preferred classes and enemies of the state.The judge needs to be removed from the bench.

And the voters in that county ELECTED him, probably based in no small part on his campaign pledge to 'Keep Our Community Safe.'But apparently, he didn't mean that to include the babies in his community. ***Editor's Note: Do you enjoy Twitchy's conservative reporting taking on the radical left and woke media?

Maria Childres aka Mark Childres (McCracken County Jail) February 9, 2024 byLaw Officer Share and speak up for justice, law & order...MCCRACKEN COUNTY, Ky. – A trans-identifying biological male in Kentucky who had been charged with felony sexual abuse of a baby, had the crime reduced to a misdemeanor and will not face jail time after reaching a plea agreement with prosecutors. Maria Childres, aka Mark Childres, a transgender daycare worker in Kentucky, was originally charged with one count of first-degree sexual abuse of a victim under 12 and three counts of first-degree criminal abuse of a child under 12, the Post Millennial reported. The sexual abuse occurred in November of 2022 at Explore Learning Academy where Childres worked in the daycare. The victim was a female baby. The criminal offense occurred while Childres was changing a diaper. The defendant was not only accused of sexual abuse, but various forms of physical abuse as well. The crime was reported after a co-worker observed Childres perform a “circular motion” while rubbing the infant’s genitalia and said, “That was her clit area, and she likes it. It just made her day.” The witness said the baby was in duress while being molested by Childres. On January 29, prosecutors amended/dismissed the felony charges in exchange for Childres guilty plea to simple sexual misconduct, which is a Class A misdemeanor, according to Reduxx. (Image via Post Millennial) As a result of the plea agreement, the judge postponed sentencing in favor of a 6-month conditional discharge. In addition to avoiding incarceration, Childres may be able to clear the criminal record by adhering to the requirements of the conditional discharge, per the news outlet. Maria Childres. (Facebook via Reduxx) Childres, who first began identifying as a female approximately seven years ago, was represented by prominent trans activist lawyer Madison Leach. Editors note: Other news outlets spelled the name “Childers.” However, the booking paperwork spelled it “Childres.” Therefore, we went with the spelling on the booking form.

The University of California system is seeing a staggering increase in the number of students who identify as either transgender or non-binary. According to data released in January, the number of undergraduate students identifying as non-binary across UC system campuses rose by over 2,000 from 2019 to 2023.The San Francisco Chronicle noted that last year, the UC changed its data collection processes and consolidated the terms ""non-binary,"" ""genderqueer"" and ""gender non-conforming"" into a singular ""non-binary category."" ""Even taking into account that shift, the number and percentage of students identifying as trans or non-binary increased significantly,"" the paper noted. The percentage of students identifying as gender non-conforming, non-binary or transgender has also tripled over the last four years (.06% in 2019 to 1.9% in 2023). Most of the students fell under the non-binary category, while transgender men and women were identified as the smallest demographic in 2023, at .2% and .1%, respectively.

Berkeley campus on July 22, 2020, in Berkeley, California. ((Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images))UC Berkeley reported a major uptick in the number of students identified as transgender or gender non-conforming, rising from .2% in 2019 up to 1.8% in 2023. The university's Director of LGBTQ Advancement and Equity, Em Huang, said a systemwide rule allowing students to use a name of their choice and gender identity on nearly all official documents may have made the school more appealing to transgender and non-binary students.The university is also in the process of converting many gendered bathroom stalls into gender-neutral bathrooms. UC Santa Cruz had the largest non-binary and transgender undergraduate population in 2023 (4% and 1.1.%). The data on UC schools comes after the results of the 2022 U.S. Transgender Survey Early Insights report, the largest survey of transgender people in the United States, was released.

Only 1% of respondents said they were ""a little less satisfied"" with their life and only 2% said they were ""a lot less satisfied.""However, 39% of those surveyed said they had been harassed on social media because of their gender identity in the last year.

Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Fox News Flash Parent claims to be victim of 'lawfare' after ex-wife, courts try to force son's gender transition Dennis Hannon said he's lost medical decision-making authority over his son By Charles Creitz Fox News Published February 10, 2024 5:00pm EST Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Father says he lost custody after he fought his ex-wife's secret transition of their young son Dennis Hannon tells 'The Ingraham Angle' he has ‘no medical decision-making authority.’ A New York parent told Fox News this week that his ex-wife, with the backing of the legal system, tried to gender transition his young son without his knowledge. Dennis Hannon of Buffalo told ""The Ingraham Angle"" he only figured out his son was living what he called a ""double life"" when a letter from his school arrived addressed to the guardians of ""Ruby Rose"" Hannon.Hannon claimed his son always arrived for visitation in male clothing and deduced that the boy had been socially transitioned and was going by female pronouns at school at age 5. A gender therapist later suggested to the father that the biological boy begin puberty blockers before age 9. BIDEN, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER FLAMED OVER ‘SCRIPTED’ CHILD GENDER SURGERY QUESTION Video ""As it stands right now, I have visitation with my son. I see him a few times a week and every other weekend,"" Hannon told ""The Angle.""He, however, underlined that he's since been stripped of medical decision-making authority for his child. ""There was never any indication that my son had any desire to be a girl, and even after it was discovered through court proceedings that he was socially transitioned in school without a diagnosis of gender dysphoria,"" he said. ""I was still court ordered to take him to a gender therapist, sometimes once a week. It was $145 per session out of pocket. They didn't accept insurance."" After about 18 months of mandated therapy, Hannon asked the provider to discharge the boy, and the therapist refused. The therapist went on to write a letter to the court about the incident, he claimed, which led to him losing health care authority. NJ REP RIPS ‘BIZARRE’ GENDER STUDIES PUSH AFTER GOV. MURPHY OPEN TO ‘ENTERTAINING’ PLANS Video""So, this is lawfare is what it is,"" Hannon said, later adding that the boy was placed on a treatment plan before any dysphoria diagnosis was ever made.The father claimed the boy never told him about his time identifying as Ruby Rose, and that he indeed only found out through the aforementioned letter and legal discovery. In comments to the New York Post, which shares common ownership with Fox News, the mother, Amy Hannon, said her child's case was not as simple as suggested by recent reports.She reportedly declined to go into specifics, but stressed there are ""two sides to every story.""""After having read the story [in the U.K. Daily Mail]… the amount of lies in that story are quite appalling,"" Amy Hannon told the paper. ""It's the child that's important here."" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Video Dennis Hannon told host Laura Ingraham that the boy is now proverbially ""awake.""""He understands. Because when this first happened, Laura, everybody wanted to be the voice for him, and there was nobody objecting to it. I couldn't object because I didn't know what I didn't know. It was totally hidden from me,"" he said. ""And when I spoke out against it, I was labeled a bigot."" Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Read our privacy noticeAs ridiculous as it sounds (and it is, without doubt, an absurd thing to have done), my wife cried when she watched her first Parkrun a few years ago.Not at the fast finishing times, although there were a few; not at the mini internal battles silently encouraging runners to eke out that tiny extra burst of effort approaching the finish line; not at the level of competition, which was so low that it was almost absent. Simply because she was overwhelmed by the inclusive nature of a community event that truly embraced everyone.A shared activity that welcomed, encouraged and in no way judged. Running for all: old and young, fast and slow, able and barely-able-but-happily-willing.People running the 5km Parkrun held every Saturday morning in the UK and around the world (Getty Images)A couple of weeks later, she began taking part, sometimes trying to beat her previous best times and on other occasions steadily plodding along while reaping the benefits of the endorphins flooding her mind and body on a collective Saturday morning run, jog or walk (delete as applicable). The tears have ceased but the original sentiment remains: this free, weekly five-kilometre event that nine million people have signed up for globally is an overwhelmingly positive thing, right?Well, it depends on who you ask. For the past few months, campaigners have been protesting in person and on social media against Parkrun, threatening to call for taxpayers’ money - in the form of funding distributed by Sport England - to be withdrawn. Their issue is the organisation’s policy of collecting participant data based on gender identity rather than biological sex. Yes, it’s the thorny subject of transgender rights and sport.Runners taking part in the Bushy Park Parkrun (PA)When someone registers with Parkrun they are asked their gender and provided four options to choose from: female, male, another gender identity and prefer not to say.According to campaigners - including the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange - such a policy allows transgender runners to identify as females, which threatens the sanctity of women’s sport.Last December, Policy Exchange released a document supported by a smattering of high-profile sportspeople, which found that there have been “at least three verified instances of transgender women (biological males) competing in the female category and setting new women’s records and distorting female rankings”.As an increasingly transphobic culture has steadily seeped into all aspects of society, so have the protests against Parkrun deepened until, this Thursday, the organisation acted. Amid calls to introduce a separate transgender records section in its results, Parkrun instead pulled various metrics from its website, including gender, course and age records.Some runners complete Parkrun each week while pushing a buggy or alongside their dog (Getty Images)Eager to portray itself as a health charity and community event rather than a formal sport or competition, Parkrun suggested the decision was not a direct response to the transgender issue and was instead aimed at removing any “disconnect between the performance data displayed so prominently on the site, and our mission to create opportunities for as many people as possible”. But do not be mistaken - the records would still be there if these campaigns were not ongoing.At this point, there is a vital distinction to make; one that could not be of greater importance. Parkrun is not elite sport. Many people enjoy using records as motivation to compete against themselves and others, with their existence solely designed to add interest and widen participation.But they do not define Parkrun - an organisation that has celebrated a steady slowing in average finishing times of participants with each passing year as more people take part.In elite or professional sport, a small number of male-to-female transgender athletes (who possess physical benefits gained from experiencing puberty as a man) have the very real potential to deny cisgender women their livelihoods, take medals and money away from those who were born female, and pose a genuine threat to the entire purpose of women’s sport.Runners gather at the start line at Heaton Park, Manchester (Getty Images for The National Lo)Those same transgender people taking part in Parkrun hold precisely none of those threats. Nothing is at stake. No money is available to be won. There is no podium, no medals. In the grand scheme of things, the records that have now been removed were entirely meaningless beyond providing some element of interest to those who might seek them out.In the same way that they did not show whether someone has surgically or otherwise changed their gender, they also did not reveal whether a runner was aided by an eager dog pulling on a lead or hamstrung by having to navigate potholes and hills while pushing a wailing toddler in an unwieldy buggy.Typically, the decision to remove the records has done nothing to appease Parkrun’s naysayers. Sharron Davies, the former Olympic swimmer turned campaigner, described the move as “cowardly” for not forcing transgender runners to be separated into their own category. To her, those who have changed gender must be stripped of a brilliant community event’s multiple health benefits unless they publicly reveal themselves to all.So no one has won. While Parkrun tries its hardest to focus solely on inclusion and positively impacting the lives of as broad a range of people as possible - including hundreds of thousands who would otherwise never engage with traditional sport or exercise - the calls for it to be stripped of funding will carry on.Maybe they will be successful and one of the most accepting, free, physical activity phenomenons of recent decades will find itself incapable of continuing. By its own admission, no one wins at Parkrun. But everyone could stand to lose. Would that really be worth it?More aboutParkrun1/5Everybody loses in Parkrun row – transgender debate will not go awayEverybody loses in Parkrun row – transgender debate will not go awayPeople running the 5km Parkrun held every Saturday morning in the UK and around the worldGetty ImagesEverybody loses in Parkrun row – transgender debate will not go awayRunners taking part in the Bushy Park ParkrunPA ArchiveEverybody loses in Parkrun row – transgender debate will not go awaySome runners complete Parkrun each week while pushing a buggy or alongside their dogGetty ImagesEverybody loses in Parkrun row – transgender debate will not go awayRunners gather at the start line at Heaton Park, ManchesterGetty Images for The National LoEverybody loses in Parkrun row – transgender debate will not go awayPeople running the 5km Parkrun held every Saturday morning in the UK and around the worldGetty Images✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It is not a race. It is not a competitive athletic event.”He added that since the event’s inception as a time trial in 2004, it has “clearly evolved” into a “health charity”.The chief executive’s comments came after a Parkrun official quit his role over the move.Mick Anglim announced his departure as Brockenhurst’s Parkrun event director on Thursday night, writing on Facebook that he had resigned “in response to HQ’s new ‘inclusive’ policy”.He later told Telegraph Sport that “everyone that I’ve spoken to agrees that the removal of age category and age grade records is a mistake”. Mr Anglim, who won the world duathlon title for over-75s in 2022, said that he would not completely abandon the Brockenhurst event, which has attracted almost 14,000 people aged between four and 90, but that the change had reduced “motivation and challenge for all age groups”.‘If the records offend you, don’t look at them’The Facebook page ‘Parkrun Statsgeek Group’, which has more than 13,000 members, launched an online poll to gauge opinion about the change. Of more than 2,200 responses, 82 per cent indicated their disagreement with the new policy.Members aired their dismay in comments.“The most disappointing news I’ve heard in a very long time,” wrote Christian Dyer. “Why would parkrun wish to take away features adored by the vast majority to please a tiny – if that – minority?! It’s simply absurd and very sad.”Nat Konners said that she had an “80-year-old friend who is motivated by going out to see if they can get the age record at different parkruns” and that they would probably now lose motivation. “How’s that fair? Seriously if the records etc personally offend you… don’t look,” she said.Paul Curtayne questioned whether people would really be put off – as has been suggested by Parkrun – by the now removed tab of records and “drill-down stats” that was previously on their websites. “It’s obviously nonsense,” he said. “I know many runners who run 40-50 minutes and are not remotely worried that there are faster people. It’s pretty patronising to suggest that.”World Athletics, along with domestic running governing bodies, has moved to ban transgender women from female competition over the past year.Campaigners are calling for a “sex at birth” category in Parkrun but organisers have refused, saying that it was a community event rather than a race. This leaves runners free to continue self-selecting their gender, amid concern that transgender people, whose transition might be entirely private, would stop attending if a ‘sex at birth’ category was mandated.Runners wearing ‘Save Women’s Sport’ T-Shirts are planning to continue their protests this weekend.Heather Binning, the founder of the Women’s Rights Network, replied: “Whilst Mr Jefferys believes that the fact Parkrun is not a race (debatable); nor a sport (debatable); he himself is missing the point that self-id is not law in this country – Parkrun receives millions pounds of public funds to increase participation of women and therefore the fact that their policies permit men to self-identify in this category is wrong on many levels.” Related Topics Running, UK Athletics Comments The Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Pic: Sky Why you can trust Sky News Sharron Davies has questioned the timing of Parkrun's decision to wipe all speed records from its website and suggested the organisation has done so due to a debate about transgender runners.Parkrun removed all speed records earlier this week and announced it will no longer be publishing data including first-place finishes, gender, course and age records. The organisation says it is because its runs are not competitive. The move came amid criticism over transgender women being allowed to compete in the female category. In December, at least three Parkrun female records were held by transgender women, according to the thinktank Policy Exchange.Speaking to Sky News, former Team GB Olympic swimmer Davies, who campaigns against trans women competing in female sporting categories, cast doubt on Parkrun's claim that the deletion was not sparked by the debate.She said: ""I'm sorry, I don't believe that this is something that they've had planned for months or years.""I believe this is a reaction to the criticism that they've had recently about the competitiveness and the course record[s].""Parkrun said it had ""made many changes"" to its website over the years ""and will continue to do so as we evolve"", in a statement published on Thursday.It also said a ""global working group"" had ""spent many months making detailed investigations and recommendations"" to ensure data on its website was ""not off-putting and doesn't imply that Parkrun is a race"".Davies had spent five years campaigning for Parkrun to change its approach to records - but she is unhappy they have been removed completely.The Olympian had instead suggested that ""extra categories"" could be added for trans athletes.She said: ""Personally, I would have preferred keeping the competitive results. But now this has happened. The men are all complaining [that the records are gone] but for five years men haven't been complaining.""Hardly anyone has wanted to listen to our voice as women [saying], 'please can we have fair sport?'.""More from Sky News:The father who takes his drugs in a 'cage'Police search Thames for suspected chemical attacker's bodyOzzy Osbourne hits out at 'antisemite' Kanye Image: Runners taking part in the Parkrun at London's Bushy Park, the largest and oldest Parkrun in the UK.

On the trans issue, I think it's very, very tricky.""Another runner, Laura, said: ""I think the debate about trans people in sport has been blown out of proportion. Make sport more inclusive, that's the conversation we should be having.""Parkrun, which organises free weekly 5km runs, began with a group of 13 friends in 2004 in London's Bushy Park and is now a phenomenon with thousands of events taking place worldwide every week, hosting millions of runners.

It’s not the Olympics after all. Parkrun is a registered charity that holds community events in 816 locations and is free to enter but requires registration. People of all levels of ability and fitness can take part and I know quite a few women who feel safer running in an organised environment than on their own. Parkrun is a wonderful concept.Some runners do not mind what time they achieve over the 5km distance, others use the information to prove to themselves that they are becoming fitter or that they are good enough to join the local running clubs, which use Parkrun to recruit new members.

It is not a race. It is not a competitive athletic event.”Instead of scrapping the records, Davies suggests adding course records for trans athletes alongside the existing male and female records.Two-time Olympian Maya Yamauchi says Parkrun have 'not addressed the issue' of gender self-identityGB News“Rather than give females their fair sports results from Parkrun … they have removed from public view all records,” Davies said.“The vast majority want simple, fair sport for all based on the biological reality of the bodies we run / race / compete with.“The feelings of all females should never matter less than the feelings of a few trans-identifying males.”She later added on social media: “Keep sport fair for both sexes!”The Women’s Rights Network said of the row that Parkrun “would rather stop publishing age category data and rankings rather than allow fair sport for women and girls”.The group added: “There’s only been uproar now because they’d rather wipe records than be fair to women.”NewsSportUK NewsOther Sport You may like WatchListenliveListen liveAbout UsOur Editorial CharterOur InvestorsWork for UsAdvertisingContact UsDiscoverNews AlertsSitemapsRSS FeedsApps & ProductsApple AppsAndroid AppsFire TVRokuTV AppsRadioTermsCookies PolicyPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseCommunity RulesMembership RulesSocials This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. © 2024 GBNEWS.

Parkrun eliminated all velocity data earlier this week and introduced it’ll now not be publishing information together with first-place finishes, gender, course and age data. The organisation says it’s as a result of its runs will not be aggressive. The transfer got here amid criticism over transgender girls being allowed to compete within the feminine class. In December, at the very least three Parkrun feminine data had been held by transgender girls, in accordance with the thinktank Policy Exchange. Speaking to Sky News, former Team GB Olympic swimmer Davies, who campaigns in opposition to trans girls competing in feminine sporting classes, solid doubt on Parkrun’s declare that the deletion was not sparked by the talk. She stated: “I’m sorry, I don’t believe that this is something that they’ve had planned for months or years. “I imagine this can be a response to the criticism that they’ve had lately in regards to the competitiveness and the course document[s].” Image: Davies is sad that Parkrun data have been utterly eliminated. Pic: Sky Parkrun stated it had “made many changes” to its web site through the years “and will continue to do so as we evolve”, in an announcement revealed on Thursday. It additionally stated a “global working group” had “spent many months making detailed investigations and recommendations” to make sure information on its web site was “not off-putting and doesn’t imply that Parkrun is a race”. Davies had spent 5 years campaigning for Parkrun to vary its method to data – however she is sad they’ve been eliminated utterly. The Olympian had as an alternative instructed that “extra categories” might be added for trans athletes. She stated: “Personally, I would have preferred keeping the competitive results. But now this has happened. The men are all complaining [that the records are gone] but for five years men haven’t been complaining. “Hardly anybody has needed to hearken to our voice as girls [saying], ‘please can we’ve honest sport?’.” More from Sky News:The father who takes his drugs in a ‘cage’Police search Thames for suspected chemical attacker’s bodyOzzy Osbourne hits out at ‘antisemite’ Kanye Image: Runners collaborating within the Parkrun at London’s Bushy Park, the biggest and oldest Parkrun within the UK. Pic: PA Davies additionally stated Parkrun athletes’ disappointment at data being wiped is proof they “did enjoy the competitive element” of collaborating. “There’s no reason why that can’t go on, but they just need to be fair and if that means bringing in some extra classifications, fantastic,” she stated. Parkrun common, Anna Garnier, advised Sky News: “I was completely gutted, I couldn’t believe it. On the trans issue, I think it’s very, very tricky.” Another runner, Laura, stated: “I think the debate about trans people in sport has been blown out of proportion. Make sport more inclusive, that’s the conversation we should be having.” Parkrun, which organises free weekly 5km runs, started with a bunch of 13 pals in 2004 in London’s Bushy Park and is now a phenomenon with 1000’s of occasions going down worldwide each week, internet hosting tens of millions of runners.

The Florida based group declared that, after extensive research, giving children gender affirming “care” has absolutely no benefits on the well-being of the child. Say it a little louder for the people in the back. The piece published on Wednesday indicated that the ACPeds reviewed over 60 studies and concluded the following: Social transition, puberty blockers, and cross-sex hormones have no demonstrable, long-term benefit on psychosocial well-being of adolescents with gender dysphoria. The 60 studies all focused on the mental health of kids who struggle with gender dysphoria, and the ACPeds also released a factsheet to help properly provide the best for kids. The factsheet noted a lot about what we’ve been seeing in transgender youth cases - many experience child abuse and neglect, treatments often lead kids to be suicidal, there’s little to no mental health benefits to these “gender-affirming” treatments and that many individuals who transition as kids end up embracing their biological gender as they get older. This point has been proven time and time again from those who detransitioned, many of whom fully regret the decisions they were enabled and encouraged to make as young kids that not only left them permanently damaged physically but worsened their mental health. Even a leftie outlet like The New York Times recently shed light on detransitioners stories and how harmful the transgender movement really is. According to its website, “The American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) is a national medical association of licensed physicians and healthcare professionals who specialize in the care of infants, children, and adolescents.” It was founded to be a voice of reason amongst the highly politicized treatment of children throughout the nation and seeks to help all children “reach their optimal physical and emotional health and well-being.” Dr. Jane Anderson, Vice President of ACPeds and lead author of the recent piece added a call to action for parents and medical professionals. ""We urge medical professionals and parents to affirm the truth about childhood gender dysphoria in the presence of harmful thoughts and address the underlying mental illness, adverse events, and family dysfunction,” she said. Her colleague, Dr. Michael Artigues, president of ACPeds echoed her statement. The studies reviewed in this paper demonstrate what many who practice medicine intuitively understand that young patients experiencing gender dysphoria deserve help in accepting and loving themselves as they are, not interventions that destroy their healthy bodies and put them on track of medicalization for life.” This group genuinely seeks the well-being of kids. Let’s hope the left, who seems to think they do the same, adopts this line of thinking and halts the mass destruction of young people’s healthy and able bodies.

SA was, until Victoria stole its crown just like it stole the Grand Prix, the proud bearer of the “Australia’s Wokest State” mantle. But, decades after its premier famously posed for photos with bearded homos dressed as nuns, even the pillow-biting crow-eaters are arking up at the dangerous idiocy of transgenderism. Australia’s first ever parliamentary inquiry into gender dys­phoria will be put to a vote in South Australia on Wednesday, with several conservative Labor MPs prepared to back the plan amid a surge in transitioning cases in South Australia. Not that trannyism is a fad or anything… The inquiry will examine all facets of treatment and support for young people with gender dysphoria, the model by which their condition is assessed, and the process by which puberty blockers and hormones can be administered, and operations approved. It will also consider the rights of parents and guardians in the assessment and treatment of young people and the role of government in providing education and health services for gender dysphoria. Will it also consider the role of creepy gender-whisperers, including those linked to Queer Theory think-tanks run by oleaginous shirt-lifters who spent the 70s and 80s advocating for paedophile rights? Just asking. The inquiry has won national support from those urging a pause in the management of gender dysphoria, including a Sydney woman suing her psychiatrist for negligence after undergoing a mastectomy and hysterectomy after just one consultation when she was 19. The backlash against transgenderism is reaching a point that even politicians are sniffing the wind. While Labor’s Left faction is opposed to the inquiry, The Australian can reveal that several conservative Labor MPs want a conscience vote on the issue so they can support the bill. Independent MP Frank Pangallo has spent the past year preparing the case for the inquiry and is being supported by the Liberal opposition in SA and by One Nation. The Australian understands Premier Peter Malinauskas – who is from Labor’s Right faction – has been canvassed privately by Mr Pangallo but has not indicated his position. Remember Homer Simpson’s advice: Never say anything, unless you’re sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do. Mr Pangallo’s push for the inquiry shows that despite Labor governments largely defending the status quo, or ducking calls to examine the issue, there are clearly many MPs in Labor ranks who share his disquiet over the case numbers and the model being used to treat young people. In his speech to parliament, Mr Pangallo relied upon FOI ­material obtained by NSW Labor MLC Greg Donnelly revealing the number of children and adolescents being treated for gender dysphoria by SA’s Women’s and Children’s Health Network. In 2020, the total number stood at 58, with 21 females and 17 males receiving puberty blockers and 13 females and seven males undergoing stage two gender-­affirming hormone treatment. Just one year later, the total number jumped to 149, with 91 ­females and 58 males receiving different forms of treatment. They included 35 females and 33 males receiving puberty blockers and 26 females and 13 males ­undergoing stage two gender-­affirming hormone treatment. Tell us again that this isn’t a fad. But, unlike fidget spinners or hula hoops, it’s a fad that’s leaving children stunted, crippled, and sterilised. SA Liberal senator Alex Antic has flagged a private member’s bill that in almost all cases would ban the use of puberty blockers and gender-affirming hormone treatment. His bill would also strike doctors from practising if they took part in such procedures. The Australian At least one politician has the guts to stand up to the bullying nutcases in womanface.

We follow the facts wherever they may lead — even if that conflicts with the official narrative of the establishment. We see that the mainstream media pretends to be impartial, but they increasingly behave like political parties. They don’t admit their own political bias, and they pretend to be neutral providers of the news when they are anything but. At The BFD we fearlessly take on that “Media Party”. We tell it like it is, and we examine the world from a different perspective — a side of the story you won’t get anywhere else. Unlike most of our competitors, we don’t take money from any government. We depend on viewers like you to crowdfund our independent journalism. It’s harder to run a company that way.

The demonstrations follow a controversial decision to stop allowing gender changes on state ID. After 10 a.m., protesters arrived in lobbies for tax collectors in Alachua, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade and Orange counties and collapsed on the ground, feigning death in the offices. Some held gravestones reading “Killed By the DMV” or “Killed by Ron DeSantis.” The protests were organized in large part by PRISM, an LGBTQ advocacy group leading the “Let Trans People Drive” campaign. The organization worked with Youth Action Fund, Equality Florida, Hope CommUnity Center, GLSEN Central Florida and SPEKTRUM Health “Participants will stage die-ins to underscore the devastating consequences of efforts to erase the transgender community’s legal recognition,” read a PRISM press release. PRISM has also asked President Joe Biden’s administration and the Justice Department to intervene and prohibit the change in policy based on the federal Real ID Act from 2005. That allows the establishment of federal criteria for government IDs. A virtual campaign through Wednesday promoted more than 650 emails to the administration seeking intervention in the Florida policy. The event served to spotlight a change in state policy on issuing state IDs. While the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) in May 2022 updated its guidelines to allow a change in gender of state IDs without proof of gender reassignment surgery, the state agency sent out a memo to Tax Collector’s Offices in January reversing that policy. FLHSMV Deputy Executive Director Robert Kynoch wrote in a memo to every Tax Collector’s Office that the term gender “does not refer to a person’s internal sense of his or her gender role or identification, but has historically and commonly been understood as a synonym for ‘sex,’ which is determined by innate and immutable biological and genetic characteristics.” That memo said having a state ID or license listing a gender that did not align with gender assigned at birth would effectively be violating Florida’s statute prohibiting false IDs. That would make individuals guilty of a felony and subject to up to five years of prison or probation and a $5,000 fine.

So the police can profile women drivers? They got your DL up on their car laptop before they ever even hit the blue lights, ya know. To pull or not to pull, that question is answered by your information on the police laptop if you just have a broken taillight or some piddly thing like going 10 to 14mph over the limit, rolling a stop sign. Your personal data is in play for the decisions cops make. Male Female or other on their laptop screen allows for their profiling women drivers. Same goes for race and weight. Race and weight have no bearing on anyone’s ability to drive a car. Why do the cops get to know that info via their laptop while deciding whether to initiate a traffic stop? Gender, race, weight on a DL, those are nothing but profiling, profiling, profiling. Reply DaveFebruary 9, 2024 at 4:44 pm Exactly! They profile because of their hatred, and rationalize because of their greed. Cops get away with heftier fines and ticketing to minorities, this is just another way to keep the working class divided and impoverished. When there is no more money in targeting minorities, they won’t hesitate to turn on white cis men. Cop’s authority will always be above the working class, it’s social caste’s all the way down. Reply BillFebruary 9, 2024 at 11:28 am Have you been to the DMV lately? How on earth would you notice that someone was dead? The staff may as well be dead for all the use they are and the customers look like they’ve died of boredom. Reply Sally BFebruary 9, 2024 at 11:47 am A useless political stunt?

Reply Dont Say FLAFebruary 9, 2024 at 12:51 pm The last “America’s Sheriff” was Joe Arpaio. How’s things going for that guy with his concentration tent camps and his criminal contempt rap sheet? Oh yeah – TRUMP pardoned the law breaking law man from Arizona. Vote GOP, the party of law and order for you, but not for us. Reply I swing You swingFebruary 9, 2024 at 2:01 pm Agreed.

Reply Keith WilsonFebruary 9, 2024 at 2:28 pm When your entire “identity” depends on the actions of OTHER people, you have a very weak point. Reply Dont Say FLAFebruary 10, 2024 at 11:02 am You’d be totally fine having “Female” stamped on your driving license, right Keith? Reply Scott W.February 9, 2024 at 2:59 pm There’s nothing controversial about requiring your chromosomes to be included on your state issued ID. The reaction of these jackasses to reality is what is controversial. Reply Dont Say FLAFebruary 10, 2024 at 11:04 am Because DL info is available to polices on their car laptop, a DL should have zero information that can be used for profiling. You know there’s cops out there who have it in for women drivers, right? And there’s other cops out there who might decide to see if the lady on their laptop will trade them a favor to get out of that DUI, too. Reply Scott W.February 10, 2024 at 4:09 pm Because somebody might do something bad isn’t a legitimate reason not to put sex on identification. Reply Dont Say FLAFebruary 11, 2024 at 11:59 am Granted, potential misuse isn’t always a reason to ban legitimate things. But what reason IS there for having gender on a driving license? What’s the point? Why’s it there? What purpose can it have other than potential abuse? Do they need to know what’s in your pants when you buy beer? No. Do they need to know what’s in your pants when you drive? No Voting? Nope. Is there anything? Why is it there at all? Was it that some sneaky female might have signed up for the military? They can do that these days openly as females. Is it a poopy room thing? Have you ever showed your DL to get into your appropriate public bathroom? No. So why? Why’s it on there? What’s the point? Is a traffic stop less threatening when its a female? If so, that gets cops killed. Cops let their guard down, that’s when they get killed. If for no other reasons, for officer safety alone, driving licenses should have gender entirely removed. Reply Scott W.February 11, 2024 at 2:29 pm It’s on ID to help identify the person, you dunce. With your logic why even have their surname on the ID. Reply Dont Say FLAFebruary 12, 2024 at 11:36 am The driving license number identifies the person, and the only need for ID when driving should be to know whether your license exists and is current. Everything else on a license these days is for profiling via the laptops in every popomobile. Reply Scott W.February 12, 2024 at 6:56 pm If I were a cop I would definitely want to know the sex of the people I had to pull over.

Iglesias / Miami Herald / Tribune News Service via Getty Images Hundreds of transgender activists and allies orchestrated die-ins at DMVs throughout Florida in protest of the recently announced policy change by the state’s Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles that disallows transgender people from changing the gender marker on their state driver’s license to reflect their gender identity. In a January letter detailing the policy shift, Robert Kynoch, deputy executive director of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, states that transgender people “misrepresenting” their gender marker on their driver’s license by listing their gender identity could be guilty of fraud and face civil and criminal penalties. “This HORRIFIC anti-LGBTQ+ policy change was directed by Robert Kynoch, Deputy Director of the FL DMV, in a department-wide memo,” the Youth Action Fund, which organized the DMV die-in protests, said on social media. “He ORDERED a BAN on accurate gender marker changes, contributing to TRANS ERASURE, while opening the door for potential suspension or “fraud” charges.” According to the Youth Action Fund, demonstrators participating in die-ins remained motionless outside of DMVs for 37 minutes, symbolizing the 37 percent of transgender people in Florida who have experienced harassment as a result of an inaccurate gender marker. Related Story News | LGBTQ Rights New FL Rule Bans Trans People From Updating Gender Marker on Driver’s Licenses If upheld, Florida would become the first state to prohibit driver’s license changes under criminal penalty. By Erin Reed , ErinInTheMorning January 31, 2024 Truthout “This protest may appear bleak, but it’s rooted in REALITY. Further marginalization of the transgender community can be DEADLY,” the Youth Action Fund said. A report by the Williams Institute states that having IDs that list a gender marker that does not align with a transgender person’s gender identity can open them up to discrimination and harassment. In fact, without accurate IDs, transgender individuals may face obstacles when traveling, seeking employment, securing rentals, and interacting with law enforcement. “Presenting inaccurate identification all too often becomes a trigger for various forms of abuse and discrimination,” a 2012 report by the Center for American Progress said. “Transgender people who may otherwise move through the world undetected by those who would discriminate against them are often ‘outed’ by an old gender marker, an old name, or an old photograph.” Florida is the only state currently categorized as “do not travel” on transgender activist and journalist Erin Reed’s “anti-trans risk map.” According to Reed, Florida has eliminated 80 percent of transgender adult care, enforces a law that permits the arrest of transgender individuals for using bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity, and is one of five states that have made it a felony to provide gender-affirming care to transgender youth. Additionally, LGBTQ rights organizations like Equality Florida and the Human Rights Campaign have issued travel advisories for the state. “Today, Equality Florida took the extraordinary step of issuing a travel advisory, warning of the risks posed to the health, safety, and freedom of those considering short or long term travel, or relocation to the state,” the organization said in a statement last April. “The move comes in response to a wave of safety inquiries Equality Florida has received following the passage of laws that are hostile to the LGBTQ community, restrict access to reproductive health care, repeal gun safety laws, foment racial prejudice, and attack public education by banning books and censoring curriculum.” In the face of Florida lawmakers’ relentless attacks on LGBTQ+ people, the die-ins orchestrated by queer Floridians who have chosen not to flee the state demonstrate the community’s steadfast refusal to be silenced. “This UNPRECEDENTED show of RESISTANCE in Orlando, Miami, Tampa, and Gainesville makes one message EXTREMELY CLEAR: When trans rights are under attack in Florida, what do we do? STAND UP, FIGHT BACK,” the Youth Action Fund said. It takes longer to read this sentence than it does to support our work.

Ron DeSantis' administration criminalizes changing one's gender on an I.D.Jacob OglesFebruary 09 2024 11:14 AM ESTFebruary 09 2024 4:01 PM ESTTransgender activists in Florida held die-in protests at driver’s licenses around the state. Dozens showed up draped in transgender flags or orange road-safe vests and laid down in lobbies and offices, drawing attention to the state’s latest erasure of trans identity. Keep up with the latest in LGBTQ+ news and politics. Sign up for The Advocate's email newsletter.The events took place following a controversial decision by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration to criminalize changing gender on a license to reflect a transition in gender identity. Prism, Youth Action Fund, Equality Florida, Hope CommUnity Center, GLSEN Central Florida, and SPEKTRUM Health organized the protests.“Participants will stage die-ins to underscore the devastating consequences of efforts to erase the transgender community’s legal recognition,” reads a press release put out by Prism.At one DMV, activists could be spotted lining up against the wall holding cardboard headstones with phrases in Spanish and English. One read “Killed by Ron DeSantis. Another said, “Killed by the DMV.”The die-ins coincide with an email campaign demanding President Joe Biden’s administration intervene, based on federal authority under the Real ID Act. Through Wednesday this week, more than 650 emails had been sent to the U.S. Justice Department and the White House.Demonstrations unfolded Friday morning in Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, Tallahassee, and Gainesville.The Florida Legislature this year is also considering legislation called the “What Is A Woman Act” that would prohibit licenses from reflecting anything other than an individual’s gender as assigned at birth.But the DeSantis administration, as it has done with anti-LGBTQ+ policy before, decided not to wait for a bill to become law before enforcing it as such.“The term ‘gender’… does not refer to a person's internal sense of his or her gender role or identification, but has historically and commonly been understood as a synonym for ‘sex,’ which is determined by innate and immutable biological and genetic characteristics,” wrote Robert Kynoch, Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Deputy Executive Director, in a memo to tax collector’s office around the state. — (@) From Your Site ArticlesFlorida criminalizes changing gender on driver’s licenses in latest attack on LGBTQ+ rights ›NewsLawNon-topicsRM Editors PickYahoo FeedPoliticscriminalizediein protestsdrivers licensesfloridaflorida legislaturegender identityjacksonvillemiamiorlandotallahasseetampatrans identitytransgender activiststransgender flagspresident joe bidens administrationtransgenderBe sure to follow Advocate on your favorite social platformWant more breaking equality news & trending entertainment stories?Check out our NEW 24/7 streaming service: the Advocate Channel!Download the Advocate Channel App for your mobile phone and your favorite streaming device!APPLE STORE - GOOGLE PLAYROKU - APPLE TV - FIRE TV - GOOGLE TVFrom our SponsorsMost PopularPoliticsgallery Here Are Our 2024 Election Predictions.

(AP Photo/Patrick Orsagos, File) Read More By DAVID CRARY Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print For decades, the plotline for LGBTQ+ activism in the U.S. was one of advances — often slow-paced and hard-fought but inexorably moving forward. Now, faced with unprecedented attacks in state legislatures, transgender rights leaders acknowledge they are playing defense — and two of the biggest groups are joining forces to counter the onslaught.“This is going to be a defense game — and a movement-strengthening game,” said Andy Marra, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund. “We have witnessed a sophisticated, well-coordinated and highly resourced effort to dismantle the years of progress that our movement has made.”The essence of the attack: Scores of bills enacted in Republican-governed states over the past few years targeting transgender people. Many of laws ban gender-affirming medical care for trans minors or bar trans athletes from competing on girls’ and women’s scholastic sports teams. With a new wave of anti-trans measures already introduced this year, the TLDEF and the National Center for Transgender Equality announced in January that they plan to merge this summer. The new organization will be called Advocates for Trans Equality; Marra will be its CEO, while its executive director will be Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, who now holds that title with the NCTE. READ MORE Kansas’ AG is telling schools they must out trans kids to parents, even with no specific law Utah governor says school board member who questioned a student’s gender ‘embarrassed the state’ A West Virginia ‘Women’s Bill of Rights’ is an effort to suppress transgender people, critics say Marra said a key moment in deciding to consider the merger came in 2022. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Gov. Greg Abbott, both Republicans, directed state child protection workers to investigate families of trans children for what Abbott termed “abusive gender-transitioning services.” “I knew we needed a stronger, bolder response to the unprecedented vitriol and legislative attacks on trans people nationwide,” Marra said.Unlike some mergers, this one is not aimed at cost-cutting or consolidation, according to Heng-Lehtinen. He said current staff from each organization will be retained, and the new organization — after adding a few new hires — will likely have a staff of about 50 by the end of the year, working out of offices in New York and Washington as well as remotely. “When you hear ‘merger,’ you think there’s some kind of crisis or duplication,” he said. “Not in this case — we simply think we’ll be stronger.”For Marra and Heng-Lehtinen — and their allies in other LGBTQ+ rights organizations — it’s crucial to keep litigating, state by state, against the anti-trans laws. While some of the measures have taken effect, others have been blocked by federal judges, including some appointed by Republican presidents. Protesters of Kentucky Senate Bill SB150, known as the Transgender Health Bill, cheer on speakers during a rally on the lawn of the Kentucky Capitol in Frankfort, Ky., March 29, 2023. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley, File) Another priority, in this election year, is to engage in political campaigns.“We need pro-trans elected officials winning their races and defeating candidates who are attacking trans people only to score political points,” said Heng-Lehtinen. He depicted the anti-trans vitriol as a backlash to the broader gains made by the LGBTQ+-rights movement in recent decades. “Anti-LGBT groups are shaking in their boots,” he said. “We’ve made a lot of progress, and that’s why they’re fighting so hard.”He’s been immersed in politics since childhood — his mother, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, served 30 years in Congress, starting when he was 3 years old.At odds with most of her fellow Republicans in Congress, Ros-Lehtinen became a staunch supporter of LGBTQ+ rights — for example, becoming the first GOP House member to support the legalization of same-sex marriage. She was vocally in support of Rodrigo’s decision to come out as a transgender man.“What makes our family so very proud of Rodrigo is that he’s so happy living an authentic life, being honest about who he is and bringing a lot of joy in our lives,” Ros-Lehtinen said in a 2016 video urging parents to accept their trans children.The national political environment — in regard to LGBTQ+ rights — has changed dramatically since then. Back in 2016, after North Carolina enacted a “bathroom bill’ restricting trans people’s use of public restrooms, there was a major backlash, including cancellation of potentially lucrative business projects and sporting events.Over the past couple of years, the corporate world has generally avoided similar threats as new anti-trans measures took effect in North Carolina and elsewhere. Sales of Bud Light plunged because of conservative backlash to an ad campaign featuring transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.Marra suggested that many corporations had become more wary of venturing into potentially divisive political issues, at a time when special-interest groups are scrutinizing how they deal with issues such as affirmative action and workforce diversity.“We would like them to stay true to their values,” Marra said. Demonstrators advocating for transgender rights and healthcare stand outside of the Ohio Statehouse on Wednesday, Jan. 24, 2024, in Columbus, Ohio. (AP Photo/Patrick Orsagos, File) The cumulative impact of the anti-trans laws has been tangible, according to surveys finding that many trans people have considered moving to another city or state that would be more accepting. Several new organizations have emerged in the past few years offering emergency funding to individuals and families affected by anti-trans legislation, either to relocate or to obtain medical care or services outside their home state.Marra, who has been active in the LGBTQ+ rights movement for 20 years, says she remains optimistic in the face of current setbacks.“We are in many ways in the fight of our lives right now, but ultimately we are on the right side of history,” she said.“This year, we have an opportunity to bring the next generation of voters along in the next chapter of the fight for equality in this country,” she added. “We need to be engaging everyday folks across the country, sharing our stories.” DAVID CRARY Crary has headed AP’s 11-person religion team since 2020.

The Republican-dominated Ohio state Senate voted Wednesday to override GOP Gov. Mike DeWine's veto of a gender-affirming care ban for minors and a ban that restricts transgender athletes' participation in girls and women's sports. (AP Photo/Patrick Orsagos, File)The Associated PressFor decades, the plotline for LGBTQ+ activism in the U.S. was one of advances — often slow-paced and hard-fought but inexorably moving forward. Now, faced with unprecedented attacks in state legislatures, transgender rights leaders acknowledge they are playing defense — and two of the biggest groups are joining forces to counter the onslaught.“This is going to be a defense game — and a movement-strengthening game,” said Andy Marra, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund. “We have witnessed a sophisticated, well-coordinated and highly resourced effort to dismantle the years of progress that our movement has made.”The essence of the attack: Scores of bills enacted in Republican-governed states over the past few years targeting transgender people. Many of laws ban gender-affirming medical care for trans minors or bar trans athletes from competing on girls’ and women’s scholastic sports teams.With a new wave of anti-trans measures already introduced this year, the TLDEF and the National Center for Transgender Equality announced in January that they plan to merge this summer. The new organization will be called Advocates for Trans Equality; Marra will be its CEO, while its executive director will be Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, who now holds that title with the NCTE.Marra said a key moment in deciding to consider the merger came in 2022. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Gov. Greg Abbott, both Republicans, directed state child protection workers to investigate families of trans children for what Abbott termed “abusive gender-transitioning services.”“I knew we needed a stronger, bolder response to the unprecedented vitriol and legislative attacks on trans people nationwide,” Marra said.Unlike some mergers, this one is not aimed at cost-cutting or consolidation, according to Heng-Lehtinen. He said current staff from each organization will be retained, and the new organization — after adding a few new hires — will likely have a staff of about 50 by the end of the year, working out of offices in New York and Washington as well as remotely.“When you hear ‘merger,’ you think there’s some kind of crisis or duplication,” he said. “Not in this case — we simply think we’ll be stronger.”For Marra and Heng-Lehtinen — and their allies in other LGBTQ+ rights organizations — it’s crucial to keep litigating, state by state, against the anti-trans laws. While some of the measures have taken effect, others have been blocked by federal judges, including some appointed by Republican presidents. Another priority, in this election year, is to engage in political campaigns.“We need pro-trans elected officials winning their races and defeating candidates who are attacking trans people only to score political points,” said Heng-Lehtinen. He depicted the anti-trans vitriol as a backlash to the broader gains made by the LGBTQ+-rights movement in recent decades.“Anti-LGBT groups are shaking in their boots,” he said. “We’ve made a lot of progress, and that’s why they’re fighting so hard.""He’s been immersed in politics since childhood — his mother, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, served 30 years in Congress, starting when he was 3 years old.At odds with most of her fellow Republicans in Congress, Ros-Lehtinen became a staunch supporter of LGBTQ+ rights — for example, becoming the first GOP House member to support the legalization of same-sex marriage. She was vocally in support of Rodrigo's decision to come out as a transgender man.""What makes our family so very proud of Rodrigo is that he’s so happy living an authentic life, being honest about who he is and bringing a lot of joy in our lives,” Ros-Lehtinen said in a 2016 video urging parents to accept their trans children.The national political environment — in regard to LGBTQ+ rights — has changed dramatically since then.Back in 2016, after North Carolina enacted a “bathroom bill’ restricting trans people's use of public restrooms, there was a major backlash, including cancellation of potentially lucrative business projects and sporting events.Over the past couple of years, the corporate world has generally avoided similar threats as new anti-trans measures took effect in North Carolina and elsewhere. Sales of Bud Light plunged because of conservative backlash to an ad campaign featuring transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.Marra suggested that many corporations had become more wary of venturing into potentially divisive political issues, at a time when special-interest groups are scrutinizing how they deal with issues such as affirmative action and workforce diversity.“We would like them to stay true to their values,” Marra said. The cumulative impact of the anti-trans laws has been tangible, according to surveys finding that many trans people have considered moving to another city or state that would be more accepting. Several new organizations have emerged in the past few years offering emergency funding to individuals and families affected by anti-trans legislation, either to relocate or to obtain medical care or services outside their home state.Marra, who has been active in the LGBTQ+ rights movement for 20 years, says she remains optimistic in the face of current setbacks.“We are in many ways in the fight of our lives right now, but ultimately we are on the right side of history,” she said.“This year, we have an opportunity to bring the next generation of voters along in the next chapter of the fight for equality in this country,” she added.

Read our privacy noticeRishi Sunak has yet again refused to apologise to the family of Brianna Ghey after making a trans joke while the murdered transgender teenager’s mother was visiting parliament.The prime minister said it is “wrong” to suggest he joked about trans people when he made a “how to define a woman” jibe at Sir Keir Starmer this week.And he said it is “sad” to drag Brianna’s family into a debate which he said was intended to be about the Labour leader’s u-turns.But, in an interview with BBC Radio Somerset, the PM was once again confronted with calls from Brianna’s father, Peter Spooner, to apologise.Rishi Sunak has refused to apologise for the jibe, made while Esther Ghey, Brianna’s mother, visited Parliament (PA)Mr Spooner has said he was disgusted with Mr Sunak and branded his comments “degrading” and “absolutely dehumanising”.In a tense exchange, presenter Charlie Taylor said: “Will you apologise now to Brianna’s father, who has said it was degrading and dehumanising? How much more do you need before you can apologise?”Mr Sunak said: “I’ve got nothing but heartfelt sympathy for all of Brianna’s family and friends… but as we saw yesterday it is yet another u-turn from Keir Starmer, that was the point I was making.”The PM was then challenged over whether he would continue making jokes about trans issues in parliament.But he said: “That is not what I was doing. I was pointing out a very clear track record of u-turns from Keir Starmer on many important matters of policy.”The row erupted on Wednesday when Mr Sunak accused Sir Keir in the Commons of being incapable of “defining a woman” and said it was one of many issues on which he had changed his mind.An angry Labour leader immediately admonished the Tory leader. He said: “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in this chamber. Shame.”The PM has been condemned for the jibe across the political spectrum, with Tory former minister Dehenna Davison said it was “disappointing to hear jokes being made at the trans community’s expense”. And minister Penny Mordaunt urged the PM to “reflect” on his remarks. Labour’s Jess Phillips called the prime minister “an absolute disgrace”.Even former prime minister Gordon Brown weighed in, saying he had acted when he once referred to a voter as a bigot, adding: “I made mistakes… but I apologised and I think that’s a lesson that all prime ministers should follow”Sir Keir on Thursday night said Mr Sunak should “do the right thing” and apologise as “swiftly as possible”.The Labour leader said: “This is nothing to do with me. This is Brianna’s father. They’ve had their child murdered and he has put his words out about what the prime minister said and it’s not good enough for the prime minister’s team to go out today and effectively say to Brianna’s father ‘you didn’t understand what Rishi was saying’.“He did understand. He’s given his reaction. The right thing to do is to apologise as swiftly as possible – not just reflect but apologise. This is a grieving father.”But the PM has steadfastly refused to backtrack on the remarks, and on Friday accused critics of dragging Brianna’s family in the face of a tragedy into politics. “I don’t think that’s right, I think it’s sad and it’s wrong,” he added.More aboutPrime MinisterRishi SunakBrianna Gheykeir starmerParliamentJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/2Rishi Sunak yet again refuses to apologise over PMQs trans jibeRishi Sunak yet again refuses to apologise over PMQs trans jibeRishi Sunak has refused to apologise for the jibe, made while Esther Ghey, Brianna’s mother, visited ParliamentPARishi Sunak yet again refuses to apologise over PMQs trans jibePrime Minister Rishi Sunak has refused to apologise for the jibe, made while Esther Ghey, Brianna’s mother, visited Parliament (Hugh Hastings/PA)PA Wire✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Rishi Sunak was met with heckles of “shame” and “disgusting” on Wednesday when he accused Keir Starmer of changing his position on “defining a woman” when the mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey was visiting Westminster. We told on Thursday how he has so far refused to apologise for the remark as the PM told Sky News it was “legitimate” for him to make the point about Starmer. READ MORE: John Curtice gives verdict on what new polls really mean for the SNP Asked by the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland if Sunak should apologise, Scottish Tory chair Craig Hoy responded: “I think that the murder of Brianna Ghey was appalling and I would express my deepest sympathies to my family who were obviously there in the House of Commons this week. “What happened to Brianna should be condemned across the political spectrum and I don’t think anybody should seek to make political points out of it.” Pressed further on whether Sunak should apologise, Hoy replied that the PM accounted for this by saying he was not aware that Esther Ghey was visiting at the time. “I think the Prime Minister and myself would agree that Brianna’s murder was absolutely horrific but I wouldn’t want this to become a political football,” he added. It was then put to Hoy that Brianna’s father had called on the PM to apologise but that Sunak has so far refused to do so. Asked if this was a “dignified way to respond to a grieving parent,” Hoy said: “It’s a matter obviously for the Prime Minister to set out what he was aware of when he made that comment and what his views are in relation to that. “He and I are absolutely of the view and I think everybody in British and Scottish politics is of the view that the murder of Brianna Ghey was absolutely appalling and I just wouldn’t want either the media or other politicians to try and turn this into a political football. It is an absolute tragedy.” READ MORE: We may not need indyref2 - Westminster is imploding by itself He continued: “I’m not sure if the Prime Minister was aware at that time who was in the gallery. “I suppose one of these things is about being authentic in politics. You have to apologise for things that you’ve done wrong and that you’ve said inappropriately. ""I don’t know what the Prime Minister knew at that particular point in time but I absolutely do know that every single politician, and this is why it’s regrettable that this is becoming a political football, aided and abetted by the Labour Party and the media, but I understand why you would ask those questions but ultimately this was an absolute tragedy and I think it would be regrettable if this became a party political issue at Westminster.” BBC Brianna Ghey PMQs Scottish Conservatives Media Politics Scotland Share Why are you making commenting on The National only available to subscribers?

Read our privacy notice Kansas' attorney general is telling public schools they're required to tell parents their children are transgender or non-binary even if they're not out at home, though Kansas is not among the states with a law that explicitly says to do that.Republican Kris Kobach’s action was his latest move to restrict transgender rights, following his successful efforts last year to temporarily block Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration from changing the listings for sex on transgender people’s birth certificates and driver’s licenses to reflect their gender identities. It’s also part of a trend of GOP attorneys general asserting their authority in culture war issues without a specific state law.Kobach maintains that failing to disclose when a child is socially transitioning or identifying as non-binary at school violates a parents' rights. He sent letters in December to six school districts and the state association for local school board members, then followed up with a public statement Thursday after four districts, all in northeast Kansas, didn't rewrite their policies.The Kansas attorney general's letters to superintendents of three Kansas City-area districts, Topeka's superintendent and the Kansas Association of School Boards accused them of having “surrendered to woke gender ideology.” His letters didn't say what he would do if they didn't specifically require teachers and administrators to out transgender and non-binary students.LGBTQ+ rights advocates saw the letters as seeking policies that put transgender and non-binary youth in physical danger but also as an attempt to tell transgender people that they're not welcome. Jordan Smith, leader of the Kansas chapter of the LGBTQ+ rights group Parasol Patrol, said forced outing will create more anxiety for students and even push some back into the closet.“It's like they don’t want us to exist in public places,"" said Smith, who is non-binary. Five states have laws requiring schools to inform parents if their children use different pronouns, socially transition to a gender different than the one assigned at birth or present as non-binary, according to the Movement Advancement Project, which supports transgender rights. Another six have laws that encourage it, the project says.Kansas is on neither list. A bill introduced last year would bar schools from using the preferred pronouns for a student under 18 without a parent or guardian's written permission, but it did not clear a Senate committee. GOP lawmakers did enact a law over Kelly's veto that ended the state's legal recognition of transgender and non-binary identities by defining male and female for legal purposes based on a person's “reproductive anatomy” identified at birth. But Republican state Sen. Renee Erickson of Wichita, a vocal supporter and a former middle school principal, said it does not cover issues about whether schools must inform parents about a child's gender identity at school.Erickson said she now favors taking a look at the bill before a Senate committee, saying it addresses a “policy gap.”“The parents have a right to know what is affecting their child. They’re an integral part, if not the most important part, in helping their child grow and develop with the values that the parent wants,” she said. But Kobach didn't cite Kansas law in his letters to the state school boards association, the Topeka school district and the Kansas City, Shawnee Mission and Olathe school districts in the Kansas City area. Instead, he cited U.S. Supreme Court decisions going back as far as 1923 that he said affirmed parents' rights to control how their children are raised. His office released copies Thursday.He told each of the four district that its policies on transgender students violated parents' rights and said two other districts in the Wichita area quickly rewrote their policies after his letter arrived. In his letter to the school boards group, he noted it provides legal help to local districts.“It would be arrogant beyond belief to hide something with such weighty consequences from the very people (parents) that both law and nature vest with providing for a child's long-term well-being,” Kobach wrote in each of the letters.State attorneys general serve as the lead lawyers for state governments, and most also oversee at least some criminal prosecutions. But they also look outward, and Kobach's letters weren't the first to issue warnings not grounded in a specific state law.Last year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent requests to at least two medical providers that don't operate in his state for information about providing gender-affirming care as part of an investigation, though it's not clear what Texas law would cover them. Washington state's attorney general invoked a law there to block Seattle Children’s Hospital from complying, and QueerMed, a Georgia-based telehealth provider, said on its website that it will not comply.As for Kobach, Tom Alonzo, a Kansas City, Kansas, LGBTQ+ rights advocate, argued that the Kansas attorney general is bent on “intentional marginalization” of transgender people.“There’s no excuse for it,” he said as he staffed a table Thursday in the Statehouse. ""I was a gay kid hiding in high school. I remember how ugly high school can be if you're out.” While the Kansas City, Kansas, district declined comment, the other three districts said they deal with transgender and non-binary students case by case and seek to work with parents. The Topeka district expressed confidence that its practices are legal. The four districts are among the largest in Kansas and together have more than 88,000 students or 18% of the total for the state's public schools. The strongest response came from Michelle Hubbard, the Shawnee Mission superintendent, in her district's response in December. She said “it is rarely the case” that students seek something “entirely opposed” by their parents.She also chided Kobach for not citing actual cases in the district of parents' rights being violated and suggested that he was relying on “misinformation” from “partisan sources.” She called his use of woke “as an insult” disappointing in an attorney general.“We are not caricatures from the polarized media, but rather real people who work very hard in the face of intense pressure on public schools,” Hubbard wrote. ___Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.More aboutKris KobachAPKansas CityLaura KellyKANLGBTQ+DemocraticRepublicanSenateWichitaGeorgiaKen PaxtonNew JerseyTexas1/1Kansas' AG is telling schools they must out trans kids to parents, even with no specific lawKansas' AG is telling schools they must out trans kids to parents, even with no specific lawTransgender Students SchoolsCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The district settled the case, paid the teacher $95,000 and revoked the policy.The judge said parents’ constitutional rights include a say “in what a minor child is called and by what pronouns they are referred.” But Kobach cited neither that case nor Kansas law in his letters to the state school boards association, the Topeka school district and the Kansas City, Shawnee Mission and Olathe districts in the Kansas City area. Instead he cited U.S. Supreme Court decisions going back as far as 1923 that he said affirmed parents’ rights.

But they also look outward, and Kobach’s letters weren’t the first to issue warnings not grounded in a specific state law.Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita launched an online form Tuesday to gather complaints about “objectionable curricula, policies, or programs affecting children” in education. His office said it will follow up on submissions that may violate Indiana law but added that materials don’t have to meet that criteria to be posted for people to review. Last year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent requests to at least two medical providers that don’t operate in his state for information about providing gender-affirming care as part of an investigation, though it’s not clear what Texas law would cover them.

Micah Kubic, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said Kobach is ignoring students’ right to privacy and called the attorney general’s stance “cruel” and “dangerous.” While the Kansas City district declined comment, the other three districts said they deal with transgender and nonbinary students case by case and seek to work with parents.

Kobach is telling public school districts that they are required to inform parents when a transgender student socially transitions or when a student presents as non-binary at school. (AP Photo/John Hanna)The Associated PressTOPEKA, Kan. -- Kansas' attorney general is telling public schools they're required to tell parents their children are transgender or nonbinary even if they're not out at home, though Kansas is not among the states with a law that explicitly says to do that.Republican Kris Kobach’s action was his latest move to restrict transgender rights, following his successful efforts last year to temporarily block Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration from changing the listings for sex on transgender people’s birth certificates and driver’s licenses to reflect their gender identities. It’s also part of a trend of GOP attorneys general asserting their authority in culture war issues without a specific state law.Kobach maintains that failing to disclose when a child is socially transitioning or identifying as nonbinary at school violates parents' rights. He sent letters in December to six school districts and the state association for local school board members, then followed up with a public statement Thursday after four districts, all in northeast Kansas, didn't rewrite their policies.The Kansas attorney general's letters to superintendents of three Kansas City-area districts, Topeka's superintendent and the Kansas Association of School Boards accused them of having “surrendered to woke gender ideology.” His letters didn't say what he would do if they didn't specifically require teachers and administrators to out transgender and nonbinary students.LGBTQ+ rights advocates saw the letters as seeking policies that put transgender and nonbinary youth in physical danger but also as an attempt to tell transgender people that they're not welcome. Jordan Smith, leader of the Kansas chapter of the LGBTQ+ rights group Parasol Patrol, said forced outing will create more anxiety for students and even push some back into the closet.“It's like they don’t want us to exist in public places,"" said Smith, who is nonbinary. Five states have laws requiring schools to inform parents if their children use different pronouns, socially transition to a gender different than the one assigned at birth or present as nonbinary, according to the Movement Advancement Project, which supports transgender rights. Another six have laws that encourage it, the project says.Kansas is on neither list. A bill introduced last year would bar schools from using the preferred pronouns for a student under 18 without a parent or guardian's written permission, but it did not clear a Senate committee. GOP lawmakers did enact a law over Kelly's veto that ended the state's legal recognition of transgender and nonbinary identities by defining male and female for legal purposes based on a person's “reproductive anatomy” identified at birth. But Republican state Sen. Renee Erickson of Wichita, a vocal supporter and a former middle school principal, said it does not cover issues about whether schools must inform parents about a child's gender identity at school.Erickson said she now favors taking a look at the bill before a Senate committee, saying it addresses a “policy gap.”“The parents have a right to know what is affecting their child,"" she said.In 2022 a federal judge hearing a northeast Kansas teacher's lawsuit concluded that her school district's policy of not informing parents of a child's gender identity at school without their consent violated a parent's constitutional right to raise children as they see fit. The district settled the case, paid the teacher $95,000 and revoked the policy.The judge said parents' constitutional rights include a say “in what a minor child is called and by what pronouns they are referred.”But Kobach cited neither that case nor Kansas law in his letters to the state school boards association, the Topeka school district and the Kansas City, Shawnee Mission and Olathe districts in the Kansas City area. Instead he cited U.S. Supreme Court decisions going back as far as 1923 that he said affirmed parents' rights. His office released copies Thursday.He told each district that its policies on transgender students violated parents' rights and said two other districts in the Wichita area quickly rewrote their policies after his letter arrived. In his letter to the school boards group, he noted it provides legal help to local districts.In each letter he said withholding such information from parents would be “arrogant beyond belief.” State attorneys general serve as the lead lawyers for state governments, and most also oversee at least some criminal prosecutions. But they also look outward, and Kobach's letters weren't the first to issue warnings not grounded in a specific state law.Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita launched an online form Tuesday to gather complaints about “objectionable curricula, policies, or programs affecting children” in education. His office said it will follow up on submissions that may violate Indiana law but added that materials don't have to meet that criteria to be posted for people to review. Last year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent requests to at least two medical providers that don't operate in his state for information about providing gender-affirming care as part of an investigation, though it's not clear what Texas law would cover them. Washington state's attorney general invoked a law there to block Seattle Children’s Hospital from complying, and QueerMed, a Georgia-based telehealth provider, said on its website that it will not comply.As for Kobach, Tom Alonzo, a Kansas City LGBTQ+ rights advocate, argued that the attorney general is bent on “intentional marginalization” of transgender people. Micah Kubic, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said Kobach is ignoring students' right to privacy and called the attorney general's stance “cruel” and “dangerous.” While the Kansas City district declined comment, the other three districts said they deal with transgender and nonbinary students case by case and seek to work with parents. The Topeka district expressed confidence that its practices are legal. The four districts are among the largest in Kansas and together have more than 88,000 students or 18% of the total for the state's public schools. The strongest response came from Michelle Hubbard, the Shawnee Mission superintendent, in her district's response in December. She chided Kobach for not citing actual cases in the district of parents' rights being violated and suggested that he was relying on “misinformation” from “partisan sources.” “We are not caricatures from the polarized media, but rather real people who work very hard in the face of intense pressure on public schools,” Hubbard wrote. ___Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

In his letter to the school boards group, he noted it provides legal help to local districts. “It would be arrogant beyond belief to hide something with such weighty consequences from the very people (parents) that both law and nature vest with providing for a child’s long-term well-being,” Kobach wrote in each of the letters.

Marie Toronto Vancouver Vancouver Island Windsor Winnipeg Search CTVNews.ca Search Vancouver 2 Vancouver groups say they were rejected by Lunar New Year parade Share Update, Feb. 9: Organizers reversed course Friday and decided to allow the two groups to participate. Read more here. The original story follows. Two Vancouver-based organizations say they were rejected from taking part in this year’s Lunar New Year parade in Chinatown. Chinatown Together and Vancouver Lunar New Year For All, told CTV News they were both invited to apply to participate by the Vancouver Chinatown Spring Festival Celebration Committee. After applying in January, both received emails stating they had been denied, and needed to show documentation they were registered non-profits. Melody Ma, a co-founder with Chinatown Together said this requirement was never communicated on the application form or included in the rules and regulations. Ma said she submitted the requested forms, the group was approved, and then days later, the decision was rescinded. “We were disappointed, we were disheartened and shocked,” Ma said. ‘Political activism’ The rejection email from the Vancouver Chinatown Spring Festival Celebration Committee – a group made up of six organizations including the Chinese Benevolent Association of Vancouver, said, “While your passion for advocacy has been recognized, it is essential to underscore that political activism finds no place within the spirit of this event.” Ma said there was nothing political about the group wanting to be included in the event. She said members had spent hours sewing banners with the words, “Chinatown Together,” and “Embracing Rainbows.” “Many of us have a strong connection to the Chinatown parade,” Ma said. “It has a significant place in our heart.” Ma grew up dancing in the parade as one of Mimi Ho’s Strathcona Chinese dancers. “Finding out that, as an adult, I can’t participate in the parade and we are banned from marching on baseless accusations, is really disappointing,"" she said. In an emailed statement to CTV News, The Vancouver Chinatown Spring Festival Celebration Committee said it’s ""committed to upholding the tradition of promoting community, collaboration and tolerance across cultures."" ""We are also committed to ensuring that the parade is a safe and inclusive event for all participants and spectators,"" the statement said, adding it will make the decision to accept or reject parade team applications based on this criteria. ‘It just feels really frustrating’ Pearl Wong, an organizer with Vancouver Lunar New Year For All – which was also denied – said the group was created due to a lack of LGBTQ representation. “We thought it would be nice to have that, as Queer and Trans people who are also of Asian heritage,” Wong said. “We wanted a group that was by us and for us.” Wong said the committee’s non-profit regulation was never relayed to organizers or outlined in the application. Ultimately, Wong said due to timing they weren’t able to apply for non-profit status and had to bow out of being in the parade. They said they followed up with the committee for clarification into the decision, but no answer was provided. “Lunar New Year is a festival of coming together, of being together with family and community, and so for them to put these gates behind folks, it just feels really frustrating to see that happen,” they said. The parade is set to take place Sunday and is one of the largest celebrations in the community, drawing thousands of people. Ma and Wong said they still plan on attending, even as spectators. Ma added that since receiving the news about the rejection, dozens of people plan to show up in solidarity Sunday for the group to celebrate what the event is all about – community. “Chinatown’s sustainability and the sustainability of this culture really depends on its youth and young people to continue these traditions like the Chinatown parade,” Ma said.

Performers carry a dragon as people gather to celebrate Lunar New Year celebrations in Victoria, B.C., Sunday, Jan. 29, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chad Hipolito Listen to this article 00:05:41 VANCOUVER — Organizers of the Vancouver Chinatown Lunar New Year parade have changed course and rescinded their rejection of two progressive and LGBTQ+ groups that they previously barred from participating. Organizing committee spokesman Frank Huang said letters had been sent to the groups Chinatown Together and Lunar New Year For All, approving their participation in Sunday's parade. Huang didn't give any reasons for the reversal in a brief interview in Mandarin late Friday. Chinatown Together's organizer, Melody Ma, said in a statement that neither group had received a formally signed invitation from the parade organizing committee. Chinatown Together and Lunar New Year For All released a joint letter Friday night addressed to the groups organizing the parade, saying they were looking for a public apology for harms caused to the LGBTQ+ community, and the youth and elders in Chinatown. ""In the last week, despite being initially invited to apply for the Chinatown Spring Festival Parade, your committee has chosen to place our groups through a series of turbulence, disappointment, public humiliation, character assassination, and harmful stigmatization stemming from your committee’s dissemination of baseless, unprovoked accusations in the public sphere after rejecting us from participating in the parade,"" the letter said. In addition to the public apology, the two groups wrote that they were also looking for a ""commitment to transparent communication regarding the qualifications for participation in future parades for all groups."" In previous letters and statements, the parade's committee had told Chinatown Together that it couldn't march because of a ban on ""political activism,"" while it rejected another group it didn't identify because of ""the potential for disruption and protests."" Sunday's Spring Festival Parade in Vancouver is celebrating its 50th anniversary and marks the year of the dragon, which starts on Saturday. The event is organized by a consortium of six groups — the Chinese Benevolent Association of Vancouver, the Chinese Cultural Centre of Greater Vancouver, the Vancouver Chinatown Merchants Association, the Chinese Freemasons Vancouver Branch, the Shon Yee Benevolent Association of Canada and social service agency SUCCESS. Ma is a community activist and vocal critic of gentrification in Chinatown. She has opposed projects such as a residential tower at 105 Keefer Street, which was approved by Vancouver's permit board last June after years of dispute. On Tuesday, she posted a letter from the parade's organizing committee on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, which said Chinatown Together's participation in the march had been rejected because ""political activism finds no place within the spirit of the event."" The letter dated Feb. 3 said the parade is ""dedicated to a sense of unity"" and is intentionally distanced from religious or political affiliations. It told Ma ""your passion for advocacy has been recognized."" In an interview before the committee changed its mind, Ma said the group wanted to participate in the parade ""despite the fact the organizers were pro-Chinatown gentrification because we wanted to put that all aside."" ""What's ironic is that by rejecting and citing political activism — whatever that means to them in this case — they are inherently politicizing the event and the decision,"" she had said. Pearl Wong, co-organizer of Lunar New Year For All, said in an interview before the decision's reversal that they weren't told why they were banned. ""Our thought process was, hey, it would be really cool if we could form a group that is dedicated for queer and trans folks of Asian descent,"" Wong said. ""We don't really understand why it has to be this hard because I don't think it's very hard to be inclusive and welcoming."" The organizing committee had said in a statement late Thursday that it accepted or rejected applications based on ""promoting community, collaboration and tolerance"" and ensuring the parade is ""safe and inclusive"" for participants and spectators. Then on Friday it released another statement saying that ""we welcome members of the 2SLGBTQ+ community to walk alongside us."" But it said ""a group did not meet our expectations because of the potential for disruption and protests at the parade that were not related to the 2SLGBTQ+ community."" It said the committee hopes to ""work through these issues"" with the group, which it didn't name, so it can take part next year. Jordan Eng, president of the Vancouver Chinatown Business Improvement Association, said the situation highlighted the complexity of Chinatowns and their social and economic fault lines. ""Chinatown is like a city in itself,"" with strong opposing views on issues such as gentrification, Eng said before the committee's reversal. ""On 105 Keefer, even within those legacy organizations, that was a really hard decision,"" Eng said, noting many groups changed positions over time to support the project. ""Our views don't necessarily align with the legacy organizations, and the last go-around for 105 (Keefer), most of those organizations did not support it as well."" Eng's groups supported the project. He said this year's parade, celebrating both the year of the dragon and the event's 50th anniversary, would play a crucial role in the revitalization of the neighbourhood after the pandemic. ""This is really a time for us to showcase Chinatown in a very positive light, in a unified light,"" he said. ""We need good news stories. We don't need people trying to bring us down."" Extra police officers will be deployed to the parade and celebrations, but Vancouver police say there are no specific public safety risks and the move is aimed at managing the large crowd.

""What's ironic is that by rejecting and citing political activism — whatever that means to them in this case — they are inherently politicizing the event and the decision,"" she had said. Pearl Wong, co-organizer of Lunar New Year For All, said in an interview before the decision's reversal that they weren't told why they were banned. ""Our thought process was, hey, it would be really cool if we could form a group that is dedicated for queer and trans folks of Asian descent,"" Wong said. ""We don't really understand why it has to be this hard because I don't think it's very hard to be inclusive and welcoming."" The organizing committee had said in a statement late Thursday that it accepted or rejected applications based on ""promoting community, collaboration and tolerance"" and ensuring the parade is ""safe and inclusive"" for participants and spectators. Then on Friday it released another statement saying that ""we welcome members of the 2SLGBTQ+ community to walk alongside us."" But it said ""a group did not meet our expectations because of the potential for disruption and protests at the parade that were not related to the 2SLGBTQ+ community."" It said the committee hopes to ""work through these issues"" with the group, which it didn't name, so it can take part next year. Jordan Eng, president of the Vancouver Chinatown Business Improvement Association, said the situation highlighted the complexity of Chinatowns and their social and economic fault lines. ""Chinatown is like a city in itself,"" with strong opposing views on issues such as gentrification, Eng said before the committee's reversal. ""On 105 Keefer, even within those legacy organizations, that was a really hard decision,"" Eng said, noting many groups changed positions over time to support the project. ""Our views don't necessarily align with the legacy organizations, and the last go-around for 105 (Keefer), most of those organizations did not support it as well."" Eng's groups supported the project. He said this year's parade, celebrating both the year of the dragon and the event's 50th anniversary, would play a crucial role in the revitalization of the neighbourhood after the pandemic. ""This is really a time for us to showcase Chinatown in a very positive light, in a unified light,"" he said. ""We need good news stories. We don't need people trying to bring us down."" Extra police officers will be deployed to the parade and celebrations, but Vancouver police say there are no specific public safety risks and the move is aimed at managing the large crowd.

Cline later apologized for provoking a firestorm of vulgar comments after she learned that the girl was not in fact trans.But the school board member defended her initial suspicions, saying that a national push to normalize transgender identities makes it “normal to pause and wonder if people are what they say they are.” Many Republican politicians have successfully spread fear about transgender individuals to garner support for athletic bans and bathroom restrictions that threaten to push trans people out of community spaces. The sponsors say such policies are needed to protect women and girls. But as laws banning trans girls from girls’ sports have spread across Republican-led states, false accusations such as this have threatened the safety of both trans and non-trans youths. READ MORE Faced with wave of hostile bills, transgender rights leaders are playing “a defense game” Kansas’ AG is telling schools they must out trans kids to parents, even with no specific law South Dakota has apologized and must pay $300K to transgender advocates In a joint rebuke with Republican Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, Gov. Spencer Cox said Cline has “embarrassed the state” by dogpiling on a child she thought to be trans. The public reprimand from the state’s executive leaders comes a few weeks after Cox signed legislation making Utah the latest state to limit bathroom access for transgender people. “We were stunned to learn of the unconscionable behavior of board member Cline and others toward a high school student today,” Cox and Henderson said in their joint statement late Wednesday. “The last thing our children need is an elected official harassing them on social media.”Cox has toed the line on transgender restrictions during his three years as governor. He vetoed a transgender athlete ban but approved legislation like the new bathroom law that critics say has given people such as Cline license to scrutinize others in public and direct vitriol at anyone whose gender expression gives them pause. A 2022 state law banning trans girls from playing on girls’ sports teams, which was enacted over Cox’s opposition, has been temporarily blocked by a judge while a legal challenge moves through court.Troy Williams, executive director of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Equality Utah, said Cline’s post triggered a modern day witch hunt in which adults tried to police the body of a child to determine if she was feminine enough.“Now that new bathroom legislation has passed the Utah Legislature and been signed by Governor Cox, we are deeply concerned these gender witch hunts will escalate and harm not only transgender Utahns, but any Utahn who does not conform to Natalie Cline’s narrow view of gender,” he said.Cox’s brand of socially conscious conservatism has led to past sparring matches with Republican legislative leaders and has sometimes placed him at odds with the national party as it has shifted further right and zeroed in on transgender people. He is up for reelection this year and faces some prominent Republican challengers.Democratic state lawmakers have called for Cline’s resignation and say they’re working with attorneys to initiate impeachment proceedings against her. Republican legislative leaders have not signaled whether they would support impeachment, but Senate President Stuart Adams said Thursday he was “looking at all options” to address Cline’s “reprehensible” behavior. The governor and lieutenant governor, meanwhile, have asked the school board to “hold her accountable.” The State Board of Education condemned Cline’s actions in a statement Thursday but said it has no power or authority to unseat her. The elected 15-member body is looking into whether disciplinary action is warranted.“Board Leadership is very concerned about this post and the harm it has caused to students and families in Utah,” the panel said. “We are deeply saddened by the events that have taken place and will be taking prompt action.”Cline has given no indication that she plans to resign. Her term ends in November, and she has filed to run for reelection. Lt. Gov. Henderson said she made a donation this week to the campaign of Cline’s Republican opponent, Jordan School District administrator Amanda Bollinger, and encouraged her social media followers to do the same.The Granite School Board will hold a special meeting Friday to discuss a resolution condemning Cline for targeting one of its students.

In a since-deleted Facebook post, Natalie Cline, a member of the Utah State Board of Education since 2020, posted a photo of the high school basketball player on Tuesday and falsely implied the student is transgender, writing: “Girls’ basketball…” Gov. Spencer Cox and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson condemned Cline for her social media posts in a joint statement Wednesday. They urged the state’s board of education to hold her accountable. They also praised the Granite School District “for taking swift action to protect this student’s safety and well-being.” “We were stunned to learn of the unconscionable behavior of board member Cline and others toward a high school student today,” the statement reads. “The last thing our children need is an elected official harassing them on social media.” Following the joint statement, the Utah State Board of Education said in a news release Thursday it can vote on actions to reprimand or censure a member, but it does not have the power or authority to unseat them. The board’s leadership is “very concerned” about Cline’s post and “the harm it has caused to students and families in Utah. We are deeply saddened by the events that may have taken place and will be taking prompt action regarding this matter as determined by the full Board.” The parents of the high school girl are urging Cline to resign from the school board, telling CNN affiliate KSL that their daughter is a tomboy who has short hair, wears baggy clothing and has muscles from going to the gym. “To look at someone’s outer appearance and make an assumption that they’re either playing in the right arena or not, based on how someone looks I don’t think is appropriate,” the girl’s mother told KSL. “It just broke our hearts that we needed to have this conversation with our daughter.” The girl’s father said the “worst case scenario” from the cyberbullying targeted at his daughter due to Cline’s post could have led her to take her own life. “What if our daughter didn’t have that strong character and have our support, and community support to where she internalized this?” he said. Granite School District said in a statement to KSL it has “significant concerns with the apparent intent” of Cline’s post and it’s “working to ensure the safety and wellbeing of this student.” On Wednesday, Cline pointed to her free speech rights while issuing a public apology in a Facebook post, that reads, in part: “My deepest apologies for the negative attention my post drew to innocent students and their families.” In the post, which has the header “Constitutionally Protected Speech,” Cline says she removed her original post to protect the player after multiple parents raised concerns, and she asserted she “never claimed the student was a boy.” “She does have a larger build, like her parents,” Cline said of the high school girl. “We live in strange times when it is normal to pause and wonder if people are what they say they are because of the push to normalize transgenderism in our society.” Cline’s statements come on the heels of a record-breaking year for anti-LGBTQ legislation and the enactments of new laws targeting transgender people, including bans on hormone treatment and surgical procedures for minors seeking gender-affirming care and transgender people using public bathrooms that align with their gender identity. In 2022, the Utah legislature banned transgender girls from competing in high school sports. The bill was vetoed by Cox, who said it targeted a marginalized group with a high suicide rate, but in March of that year GOP lawmakers overrode the governor’s veto. That prompted a lawsuit filed by the parents of three teenage transgender girls that asked a court to declare the ban unconstitutional and block its enforcement. In August 2022, a Utah judge granted a preliminary injunction allowing transgender girls to compete on girls’ teams “only when it is fair, as confidentially determined by a legislature-created commission,” reads the decision by Judge Keith A. Kelly, from the Third Judicial District Court for Salt Lake County. School board reprimanded Cline in 2021 In their joint statement, Cox and Henderson noted the incident was “not the first time that board member Cline has embarrassed the state of Utah and the State Board of Education.” Cline was issued a letter of reprimand by the board in August 2021 after she posted a photo of a pride flag hanging at a church facility adjacent to Layton High School with the comment, “the world is too much with us,” according to CNN affiliate KSTU. The letter, obtained by KTSU, reads in part: “Since being sworn in as a Board member approximately eight months ago, you have engendered controversy, frustration, and anger toward the Board, certain schools, certain educators, and certain student populations with statements you have posted on your social media regarding our LGBTQIA+ community.” In July 2023, the board concluded an investigation into complaints regarding Cline’s statements on social media, clearing her of wrongdoing, according to a news release. Cline then responded on social media, saying the board’s leadership informed her in an email after the findings were released that they still “determined there to be merit to the concerns.” The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

A transgender identifying female (so...a male) sued his ex-boyfriend after the boyfriend threw out the tranny's “preserved testicles.” Reduxx Magazine posted video testimony from Brianna Kingsley, who sought the return of the testicles and $6,500 for damages over the loss of “deez nuts.” What the heck has our society come to!? Kingsley, a biological man, identifies as a Muslim woman and lives in the Detroit, Michigan area. Apparently Kinglsey had his testicles removed as part of his gender-affirming “care”, and now wants them back. Though the story broke back in August, Reduxx’s post of the court hearing has re-upped concern - and mockery - over how delusional our society has gotten. “She had had her testicles removed,” William Wojciechowsk, the ex, said in the hearing. “I believe if I recalled correctly, it was March 23 and they were left in the fridge. I wanted nothing to do with it. I thought it was odd but I try not to judge because everybody’s a little different.” Yeah, no kidding. It’s weird enough that Kingsley wanted to get his testicles removed to further convince himself that he’s a girl - but to keep them in the fridge? “Odd” is putting it nicely. “They were there from April of 2022 until July of 2023, when I disposed of them,” Wojciechowsk told the judge. The video cut to Kingsley talking again. He stood there in a turban, holding a fluffy dog and said, “that physical anomaly [the balls] has been a point of stress in my life since I can remember and my middle name that I chose is Dee because my whole life I’ve been called Big D. I’m Dee from the D and I thank God that these ‘deez nuts’ were extracted and they were put into a biohazard bag.” “For s**ts and giggles, I put them in a mason jar and I put them in the fridge next to the eggs,” Kingsley confessed. A trans-identified male in Michigan is suing his ex-partner for the return of his preserved testicles, which he had kept in their shared fridge following his genital surgery. Brianna Kingsley, who identifies as a Muslim woman, is demanding $6,500 for the loss of ""deez nuts."" pic.twitter.com/0JRVQiqRb4 — REDUXX (@ReduxxMag) February 8, 2024 Firstly, it always baffles me when transgender people, who clearly don’t listen to anything the Bible or God says, thank God for His assistance in their transgender “care.” Secondly, imagine opening up the fridge to make an omelet. You reach to grab a carton of eggs and your hand grazes a jar with year-old surgically extracted human testicles inside. Related: ‘Dragging’ Kids Away from Normalcy: Groomers on the Go That takes cringe, and honestly the idea of a gag reflex, to a whole new level. But still, Kingsley's suing over the supposed loss. “The amount that I’m claiming is for the damages of not having these nuts with me,” Kingsley added confidently. What, was he going to snuggle them when going to sleep or something? In response to the video posted by Reduxx, many individuals were in disbelief. “HOW IS THIS REAL,” one commentedwhile another asked, “Is this satire?” Others said things like, “Gender Ideology exacerbates existing mental disorders and creates them where they didn't exist before,” while another said, “What a time to be alive!” It really is unfortunate that this story isn’t satire. I hope Mr. Brianna gets his nuts back safe and sound and then checks himself into the psych ward.

As they shared about their athletic career experiences, Gaines and Hamilton were met with transgender activists at the event. The activists, draped in transgender pride flags and themed clothing, made their presence known with random disturbances from the crowd. One activist was seen dressed as a shark to mock Hamilton, who survived a 2003 shark attack, which resulted in her left arm being bitten off. After the shark attack, Hamilton was not deterred and returned to professional surfing. Surfer Bethany Hamilton talks to fans at story hour. (Photo credit: BRAVE Books 02.02.24) “We’ve seen activists at almost every one of our story hours. Sometimes they’re noisy, sometimes they’re dressed in drag, but these were downright nasty,” BRAVE Books CEO Trent Talbot told the Washington Examiner. He added, “The activist who showed up dressed as a shark to target Bethany Hamilton is a terrible person. Once again, those who claim they are most tolerant turn out to be the most callous.” Transgender activists came to Riley Gaines and Bethany Hamilton’s story hour event on Friday. A shark fin can partly be seen in this photo.

Another person wrote on social media, “I’m sorry your whole identity is attacking marginalized people. That’s not what we’re about and we will be there tomorrow to remind you queer people exist.” (Photo Credit: BRAVE Books 02.02.24) Despite the transgender activists, Gaines was inspired by a long line of young girls and swimmers who came out to show support. “I’m so grateful for the people of Missouri who came out to the story hour. The presence of a group of confused people dressed as a shark and clothed in pride did nothing to stop hundreds of families and young girls from taking in messages of truth and faith at our BRAVE Books story hour,” Gaines said. The talk at the Library Center also included book readings of the new children’s books Happy No Snakes Day by Gaines, which advocates standing up for truth despite being afraid, and Surfing Past Fear by Hamilton, which details a journey of overcoming fears to accomplish big dreams. Both books are published by up-and-coming conservative Christian book publisher BRAVE Books. While at the event, Gaines presented Hamilton with the Riley Gaines Center’s 2023 “True Woman of the Year” award. Special attendees of the story hour included Missouri Secretary of State John “Jay” Ashcroft and former Division I collegiate swimmer Valentina Gomez. Last week, Hamilton slammed transgender athletes in women’s sports. “Male-bodied athletes should not be competing in female sports. Period,” she said on social media. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Hamilton was previously celebrated in various Rip Curl ads, but she and the surfing retail company parted ways in November when they promoted social media posts embracing a biological man who identifies as a woman. Gaines famously competed with biological male Lia Thomas, who identifies as a transgender woman, in the 2022 NCAA Championships. Following her experience with Thomas, she became an outspoken defender of maintaining the integrity of women’s sports, becoming connected to Outkick and nonprofit organizations, including the Independent Women’s Forum and the Leadership Institute, to help grow her campus outreach to young women.

Riley Gaines poses with her Brave Books title, 'No Snakes Day.'(Credit: Brave Books) Brave Books’ latest wave of library Story Hours is taking on new life in 2024. On Friday, at the Library Center in Springfield, Missouri, professional swimmer and activist Riley Gaines and Bethany Hamilton—the champion surfer who survived a shark attack and continued to compete and win, partnered together to read from their Brave Books. Advertisement Hamilton's title, Surfing Past Fear, is about overcoming fearful and limiting thoughts in order to stay in the game and beat the odds. Meanwhile, Gaines' first title, Happy No Snakes Day, is about the dangers of believing in lies, and that standing for truth is worth it, no matter what the consequences. Both of these women are vocal opponents of transgender men participating in women's sports, but they were also there to encourage and support families in building an Army of Truth in a culture that appears to want to traffic in lies and mistruths. Of course, there cannot be a Brave Books Story Hour event without the inevitable ""peaceful protest."" Female athletes Bethany Hamilton and Riley Gaines — both known for their public opposition to transgender athletes in women's sports — are visiting The Library Center on Friday afternoon for a shared story hour.Hamilton, a professional surfer who lost her left arm in a shark attack in 2003, and Gaines, a former competitive swimmer, are hosting Brave Books Story Hour at The Library Center at 4 p.m. Friday. Hamilton and Gaines will read from their books, ""Surfing Past Fear"" and ""Happy No Snakes Day,"" respectively, during the event that is free and open to the public. Promotional materials announcing the event note that it is not sponsored by the Springfield-Greene County Library District.[...]When local LGBTQ activists and wives Brittany and Heather Dyer learned about the Brave Books Story Hour on Wednesday, they felt a fire ignite within them, Brittany Dyer said. In response, the two have planned a protest to take place during the story hour. Brittany Dyer is a member of The GLO Center executive board and has volunteered with PROMO, one of Missouri's largest LGBTQ advocacy organization.The Dyers are encouraging folks to come sit quietly during the story hour, wearing LGBTQ-inclusive clothing. Brittany Dyer said she doesn't want to get loud; she just wants to take up space.""When I see someone who has actively engaged with hate speech on a national level coming to our community to read a book that is also based in bigoted hate to our children, it's hard to sit back and not try to take up some space in that room,"" Dyer told the News-Leader on Wednesday.

Hamilton was recently dropped as a spokesperson for Ripcurl because of outspokenness on the subject, and was replaced by a transgender man. Ripcurl deliberately chose to drop a biological woman who epitomizes strength, perseverance, power, and grace and ran full bore into the oncoming train of wokeness. As one commenter noted, they are getting the full ""Bud Light,"" treatment. Advertisement If the photos from The Library Center Story Hour are any indication, it looks like they had a capacity crowd of avid Brave Book readers and not a whole lot of LGBTQ representation. Not a rainbow shirt or placard in this bunch.The crowd of mostly young girls appeared to be thrilled at meeting Hamilton in person. Here are Hamilton and Gaines with their fans. And the Dyers and their LGBTQ resistance?It was at our Library Center here in Springfield that I led a small protest on. It was also a violation of the Library policy…— Brittany (@prideforMO) February 3, 2024It seems their small protest had an equally small impact.

Funny too, since these are the people who will talk your ear off about ""acceptance"" and ""tolerance"" when they corner you at a party.Just kidding, they don't get invited to parties.Gaines and Hamilton were in Springfield, Missouri, on Feb. 2 for an event called Brave Books Story Hour, which was hosted at The Library Center. The two women's sports advocates were there to read books, with Gaines reading her children's book, Happy No Snakes Day.Additionally, Gaines — the host of the Gaines For Girls podcast — presented Hamilton with the Riley Gaines Center’s 2023 ""True Woman of the Year"" award.""Very cool,"" is what a nice person would say. However, some very uncool people decided to show up in a bid to rain on everyone's parade.While they were probably a little miffed that the story hour wasn't being led by drag queens, the bigger issue at hand for them was that Gaines and Hamilton had the audacity to fight for fairness in women's sports.So, at least one protester sent out a call to arms for any other progressive lunatics who weren't busy doing nothing.Never mind the hilarity of ordering people to wear ""inclusive"" shirts (whatever those are) to protest an event that says ""All are welcome!"" on the poster, a few people took up the offer to ruin storytime for children.Gaines shared a picture of one of the ""protesters"" (you'll see why that's in quotes in a second) who showed up with a stuffed shark in an attempt to mock Hamilton, a woman most would consider an exemplary role model for not just young girls, but all kids.Yeah, not cool… and speaking of ""not cool,"" it was probably getting a little toasty under the mask that that person wore (to the shock of absolutely no one).That wasn't the only demonstrator who thought the best way to voice their disagreement with Hamilton's views was to mock her. ""Civility, be damned!"" is apparently the rallying cry of these lunatics.""We’ve seen activists at almost every one of our story hours. Sometimes they’re noisy, sometimes they’re dressed in drag, but these were downright nasty,"" BRAVE Books CEO Trent Talbot said to The Washington Examiner ""The activist who showed up dressed as a shark to target Bethany Hamilton is a terrible person. Once again, those who claim they are most tolerant turn out to be the most callous.""READ: CAITLYN HENNER TELLS RILEY GAINES ABOUT BEING USED BY MEDIA, THE LEFT FOR BEING TRANSGENDER These Particular Demonstrators Weren't Looking To Protest, They're Just Not Good PeopleTalbot is exactly right. This isn't about tolerance. It's not about women's sports. It's not even about protesting something they don't agree with.Those who showed up to mock Hamilton, simply aren't good people.They want to exercise this in public, but they're cowards who aren't comfortable dealing with the consequences of their actions. So, they hide behind the facade of protesting to support the rights of the ""marginalized"" and the ""downtrodden,"" maaaaaaan.While there are no doubt some, who believe they're doing the right thing, people like this who only showed up to mock Hamilton are just looking for an excuse to be nasty to people under the guise of being the ""good guys.""Of course, no one falls for that. We all know they're monsters.So that's why it's good to see that while people like this dropped by in an attempt to mock someone they disagree with and to ruin other people's good times it didn't work.I sure see a lot of smiling faces in that photo.It's fantastic that a few bad apples fell well short of their goal of ruining everyone's good time.And nothing is going to eat away at them more than knowing that despite their best efforts to make everyone as miserable as they are, they failed.Tags#bethany hamilton#riley gaines#ProtestorsWritten by Matt ReigleMatt is a University of Central Florida graduate and a long-suffering Philadelphia Flyers fan living in Orlando, Florida.

Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Media Riley Gaines slams 'insufferable' trans activists mocking Bethany Hamilton at library event: 'So tolerant' Riley Gaines and Bethany Hamilton read from their children's titles at a Brave Books library event on February 2 By Kristine Parks Fox News Published February 7, 2024 7:45am EST Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Riley Gaines, Bethany Hamilton to host ‘pro-God,’ ‘pro-America’ story hour Surfer Bethany Hamilton and ‘Gaines for Girls’ podcast host Riley Gaines join ‘The Story’ to discuss Ohio blocking transgender athletes from women’s teams. Transgender activists crashed a Missouri library event with former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines and surfing legend Bethany Hamilton last Friday, with at least one activist appearing to mock the one-armed professional surfer. The two female athletes were hosting a children’s story hour featuring their inspirational titles about overcoming adversity from conservative book publisher Brave Books at The Library Center in Springfield, Missouri, on Feb. 2. Gaines, an Outkick contributor and host of the podcast ""Gaines for Girls,"" and Hamilton have faced boycotts and backlash from the left for speaking out against the rise of biological men entering female sports competitions. After failing to get the February 2 event canceled, transgender activists showed up draped in pride flags and apparel and made random disturbances during the story hour, Brave Books told The Washington Examiner. THERAPIST BLOWS WHISTLE ON HOSPITAL PUSHING TEEN GENDER TRANSITIONS: ‘DESPERATE TO HELP MY PATIENTS’ Sports stars Riley Gaines and Bethany Hamilton have become leaders in the fight to protect women's sports from the incursion of male competitors. (Courtesy Brave Books) Gaines shared how one activist came to the event with a stuffed shark doll to mock Hamilton, who lost her arm in a shark attack as a teenager.""How messed up is this? This protester brought a shark stuffed animal to mock Bethany Hamilton who lost her arm to a shark. Miserable, insufferable people. But oh so 'tolerant,'"" she wrote on X. Gaines told Fox News Digital that it was just another example of ""the left's open-mindedness, tolerance, and acceptance"" ""on full display.""""This is the tactic they use time and time again. They want so desperately to mock, intimidate, and threaten those they don't agree with into silence, but this was a step too far. I have no words to describe how messed up it is to directly mock Bethany Hamilton and her traumatic experience that cost her arm by bringing a shark to a children's story hour. Dare I call this protester an ableist?"" she reacted in a statement. Gaines continued, ""Bethany embodies a strong, courageous woman that is a role model for all. But at the end of the day, I’m glad those activists came out to the BRAVE Books story hour. They needed to hear the stories read even more than the kids."" SURF LEGEND BETHANY HAMILTON MAKES STANCE ON TRANS INCLUSION IN WOMEN'S SPORTS CLEAR Legendary surfer Bethany Hamilton wrote the children's title ""Surfing Past Fear,"" published by Brave Books. Hamilton became one of America's most famous surfers despite losing her left arm in a shark attack at age 13. (Courtesy Brave Books)Brave Books CEO Trent Talbot said activists often show up at their story hours but the ones who showed up at the Missouri event were ""downright nasty.""""We’ve seen activists at almost every one of our story hours. Sometimes they’re noisy, sometimes they’re dressed in drag, but these were downright nasty,"" Talbot told the Examiner. ""The activist who showed up dressed as a shark to target Bethany Hamilton is a terrible person. Once again, those who claim they are most tolerant turn out to be the most callous,"" he added.Hamilton earned acclaim as one of the world's most successful surfers, despite losing her left arm during a shark attack in 2003 when she was just 13 years old.

(Amanda Edwards/Getty Images)She has faced criticism for speaking out against the World Surf League after they changed their rules to allow transgender women to compete at the highest level in professional surfing against biological women. She said she wouldn't be competing in or supporting the World Surf League while the rule stands. Last week she doubled down on her stance, writing on X, ""Male-bodied athletes should not be competing in female sports. Period."" Hamilton recently told Fox News Digital that she's faced death threats because of her advocacy to restore fairness in women's sports.""It makes you sad that society can be so gnarly,"" she added.

It stated that individuals who wanted to register a gender change needed to have reproductive organs, including testes or ovaries, removed.

Canadian website Rebel News posted footage showing three trans athletes playing for the Seneca Sting and two for the Centennial Colts in a Jan. 24 game. The trans athletes played throughout the full game — while biological females were left warming the benches, according to the right-wing website that regularly turns up to sporting events with trans competitors. The five were also dominant in the game, helping Seneca win the best-of-five series, beating Centennial by a score of three games to one, the site said. Rebel News said it attended the game after a tip-off — angering match officials and staff, several of whom asked them to leave and stop filming. The site’s David Menzies was filmed repeatedly asking people there, including Centennial coach Andrew Mallory, why they were using “male players.” 4 A video allegedly showing five trans players taking part in a Canadian women’s volleyball game has sparked outrage. Rebel News/YouTube “I’m not,” Mallory replied bluntly. Rebel News claimed that its “volleyball insider told us that the situation is so dire that it is no longer safe for biological women to compete,” claiming that two female athletes recently suffered concussions in incidents involving trans women, including one who played as a man last season. Its tipster said at least six trans women play in the women’s league, which is governed by the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association. 4 Three biological males played for the Seneca Sting and two for the Centennial Colts, according to Rebel News. Rebel News/YouTube The league’s policy states that a “trans female (MTF) student-athlete being treated with testosterone suppression medication for Gender Identity Disorder or gender dysphoria” cannot compete on a women’s team until after “completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment,” the Blaze reported. The video from the Jan. 24 game sparked a backlash, further angering many already concerned for the future of women’s sports. “Just how wrong is this? Yup, this wrong,” tennis legend Martina Navratilova commented to an X post of the report and footage. “This has to stop!” She was replying to a post by British Italian author and entrepreneur Paola Diana, who wrote: “This is not diversity. This is cheating. This is insanity. This is misogyny.” 4 The conservative news outlet said the trans players were clearly dominant. Rebel News/YouTube 4 Seneca won the best-of-five series, beating Centennial by a score of three games to one.

We have a load of anger poppin’ off in Toronto, Canada, right now following a women’s college volleyball match that included five transgender athletes (all biological men) playing in place of females.The game went down on Jan. 24 between Seneca College and Centennial College and featured a total of five biological men, with Seneca having three and Centennial having two. (RELATED: Well, Well, Well: Looks Like Conservatives Bullied Bud Light Into Making A Funny, Mulvaney-Free Super Bowl Ad) As you would expect, the men completely dominated the female competition, and also in not-so-shocking news, all five of the trans athletes remained on the court for the entire match. Well, following the game, Rebel News reporter David Menzies appeared to be trying to confront the transgender athletes, but instead came across this leftist lunatic who absolutely spazzed after being questioned about this whole situation.

Here in America, and in the usual places like Portland and Seattle, a trans athlete shows up every now and then to create chaos in a sport. In Canada, they’ve got not one, not two, not three, not four, but FIVE trans athletes in ONE game. Talk about pulling the LeBron… Say what you want about America and our problems, but Canada is obviously in a much worse state. I mean, hell, did you see all of those dudes scared to say something when Menzies asked them about everything? Transgender Volleyball Player Spikes Ball And Injures Woman It’s probably because they were scared to get arrested for “hate speech.” That’s Canada in 2024, man. Sad. God bless, America.

Viloria, who plays for Centennial College, allegedly ""attacked the ball with heavy force"" and hit a female player from La Cite College in the head on November 12, 2023, causing a concussion.On January 22, 2024, it is also alleged that Seneca College's Franz Largadas concussed another female player from La Cite College when he ""attacked the ball with heavy force.""Viloria and Largadas were joined by Ara Telan, Jess Garcia, and Jaque Ronquillo to make a total of five men playing in the Centennial vs. Seneca match.Menzies reported that the game was ""hard to watch"" at times and added that ""the men were definitely the dominant players on the court,"" especially in spiking the ball.Five of the players at this women's college volleyball tournament in Toronto were men.

You could live in Canada. If men playing in women’s sports are a burr under the saddle of sane Americans, in Canada men are well on the way to dominating women’s sports. Last week in Toronto two members of the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association — the Centennial Colts and the Seneca Sting — engaged in what was supposed to be a female volleyball game, according to Rebel News. The problem? Not all the players were biological females. Advertisement - story continues below It turned out that five of the players were biological men — two on the Colts and three on the Sting. The Sting won. Why wouldn’t they? They had superior male firepower. To make matters worse, the male players were “always” on the court. Five female players were consequently benched. Another way to say it is that the women substitutes were canceled. Trending: Broadcast Cuts Away from Travis Kelce as He Goes Completely Off the Rails at Super Bowl Parade WARNING: Graphic content. Advertisement - story continues below An anonymous source who feared cancel culture reprisal stated the following, according to Rebel News: “Recently, there have been two major head injuries to female volleyball athletes in the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association (OCAA) caused by transgender men [‘transwomen.’] The first injury, on November 12, 2023, was a concussion caused by C.L. Viloria who plays the middle position for Centennial College. During a game at Centennial College vs. La Cite Collegiate, Viloria attacked the ball with heavy force and hit a La Cite volleyball player in the head.” Should trans athletes be banned from women’s sports? Yes No Completing this poll entitles you to The Western Journal news updates free of charge via email. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Yes: 99% (1055 Votes) No: 1% (12 Votes) Injuries in volleyball are not out of the norm, but let’s face it, when a man spikes the ball it comes at a greater velocity. “The second injury on January 22, 2024, was a concussion caused by a transgender woman, Franz Largadas,” the source continued. “During a game at Seneca College vs. La Cite Collegiate, Largadas attacked the ball with heavy force and hit a La Cite player in the head. In the 2022-23 season, Franz was listed on the Seneca College men’s volleyball team roster and is now on the women’s volleyball team roster this year.” Currently, there are six transgender men in the OCAA,” the source continued. “Five of which are not on any gender-affirming hormone therapy or have not had surgical gonad removal. There is no current policy in the OCAA that is listed publicly on their website about eligibility of transgender women.” Advertisement - story continues below Apparently in Canada, all a guy has to do to get on the women’s volleyball team is to claim he is female. I wonder if a man who identified as an alligator would be accepted into a Florida swamp. When is the insanity going to be put to an end? When there are no women in women’s sports? Related: Florida 19-Year-Old Faces Felony Charges After Allegedly Leaving Skid Marks on 'Pride' Display It’s not just Canada. The whole Western world has gone mad. American trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney was named by the British magazine “Attitude” as its “Woman of the Year.” Here at home, Admiral Rachel Levine, “the nation’s highest-ranking openly transgender official,” was named one of USA Today‘s “Women of the Year.” In Australia, legislation allowing people to change the sex recorded on their birth certificate by simply wanting to do so is actually considered, according to Government News. Advertisement - story continues below It’s nothing less than a war on women. Normally, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. When it comes to men taking over the roles of women — especially in sports — imitation may as well be assassination. Normal times call for normal measures. These are not normal times. They’re dangerously crazy and it’s time for the insanity to be stopped — if we aren’t already too far gone.

The match between Seneca College and Centennial College on Jan. 24 featured five men, three for Seneca and two for Centennial. Advertisement As expected, the men ‘overwhelmed’ their female competitors. With their biological advantage, all five of the trans athletes stayed in for the entire duration of the volleyball match. The Ontario Colleges Athletic Association has reportedly allowed this imbalance in their women's athletics to happen. One major concern around the inclusion of trans athletes in women's sports is the accompanying injuries that transpire from pitting one athlete against a physically superior athlete.Women have suffered serious repercussions from competing against trans athletes in volleyball. Last year, one story out of California involved a girl suffering a concussion after absorbing a spiked ball from a trans player. The trans player later used the play in his highlight reel.

Photograph: Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty ImagesUS newsBiggest ever survey of trans Americans finds 94% happier after transitionThe 2022 US Trans Survey of 92,000 transgender adults finds continued discrimination, harassment and even violence at workJessica Glenza@JessicaGlenzaWed 7 Feb 2024 11.56 ESTLast modified on Wed 7 Feb 2024 13.28 ESTThe largest survey of transgender Americans ever conducted has found trans people continue to suffer discrimination, harassment and even violence at work, in medicine and at school – but that people who transition have much higher satisfaction in life, and many have supportive families.This is the first report to document transgender experiences en masse in eight years, and comes amid sustained political attacks on trans rights from conservatives.Wishes come true for trans youth thanks to Transanta donors’ goodwillRead more“There’s still a drought of information available to lawmakers, the media and advocates regarding our experiences and our needs,” Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, executive director of the National Coalition for Transgender Equality (NCTE), said, according to NBC News.“At best, we’re working in a vacuum of information. At worst, we’re combating dangerous misinformation being spread by anti-trans extremists,” he continued. “Without question, the misinformation and lack of understanding is underpinning these escalating legislative attacks against our community.”The report, called the 2022 US Trans Survey, presents an early look at findings from a survey of more than 92,000 people who identify as binary or nonbinary transgender adults. It is the first such report since the NCTE produced a survey of more than 28,000 individuals in 2015. Individuals were asked a variety of more than 600 possible questions. No respondent received all questions.Importantly, the transgender survey is large but is not random. Although surveyors weighted the responses to try to account for biases, people who took the survey might still be unrepresentative of transgender people living in the US as a whole.The report found that 94% of transgender individuals who live at least part of the time in a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth – in other words, who “transitioned” – were either “a lot” (79%) or “a little more satisfied” (15%) with their lives. Nearly 98% of respondents were receiving some kind of hormone replacement therapy, which made them “a lot” (84%) or “a little” (14%) more satisfied with their lives.“Obtaining hormone therapy through the informed consent model and having access to surgery has definitely changed my life for the better,” one survey respondent, named Taylor, said. “It certainly didn’t fix all of my problems instantly, but it fixed a lot of problems that my dysphoria caused. Now that I’ve been on HRT and had surgery, I can live my day-to-day life without pain, dissociation, and misery.”Conversely, the sustained political attacks on transgender individuals, almost entirely from the right wing, made about half of trans respondents (47%) consider moving location. At least 10 states force trans individuals to use public bathrooms that correspond to their gender assigned at birth in at least some situations, as opposed to a choice aligned with the gender they identify as; 22 states ban gender-affirming care for transgender youth; 24 ban transgender youth sports participation.Transgender individuals also continue to suffer discrimination, harassment and even violence. More than a third were experiencing poverty (34% compared with 12% of the US population). More than one in 10 (11%) said they had been forced out of a job because of their gender identity, and about 18% were unemployed (compared with 3.5% of the US population in December 2022).Further, nearly one-third (30%) said they were verbally harassed in the last 12 months and 39% said they were harassed online. About one in 10 (9%) said they were offered unequal treatment. Three per cent said they were physically attacked in the last 12 months.These experiences contrasted sharply with the support many trans individuals received from family, support that tended to increase with age. Forty-three per cent of trans individuals aged 16-17 said their families were supportive, all the way up to 63% of individuals older than 65 who felt their families were supportive.“My whole life has been affected by the fact that my family was very accepting of me,” said Amanda, who is older than 50. “I’m not exactly sure why, but both of my parents always supported my gender and sexual expression even before it was popular to do so. They would intervene at school and in the neighborhood, so I never had the problems that most people had growing up.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsTransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsnewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUSUS elections 2024WorldEnvironmentUkraineSoccerBusinessTechScienceNewslettersWellnessNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Early insights from the survey - which aims to broadly examine the experiences of transgender people in the United States - were released on Thursday. The findings show that people who transitioned were largely happier with their life after the process, though many people who identify as transgender or non-binary said they dealt with discrimination in the workplace or in healthcare settings. Some respondents said that they were even considering moving across state lines to avoid discriminatory legislation. ""Those of us who provide gender affirming care find that nearly all of our patients are very satisfied with their medical care but are anxious because of hostility in some parts of society,"" said Dr. Joshua Safer, the executive director of the Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery in New York's Mount Sinai Health System. Survey finds increased satisfaction after transitioning When asked how they felt about life after transitioning to their preferred gender identity, more than three-quarters of respondents said they were ""a lot more satisfied"" with their life, while 15% were ""a little more satisfied."" Three percent of respondents said their satisfaction with life did not change with transitioning. A similar percentage were less satisfied – 1% of people were ""a little less satisfied,"" and 2% of people were ""a lot less satisfied"" with life. Safer said the results of the survey ""mirror what we practitioners believe we are seeing in practice,"" calling the statistics around gender-affirming hormone treatment ""especially striking."" People who were taking hormone treatment overwhelmingly reported being more satisfied with their lives. 84% of people said that taking hormones to match their gender identity made them ""a lot more satisfied,"" and another 14% of people were ""a little more satisfied"" while on hormones. CBS Reports explores laws restricting gender-affirming care for transgender minors 04:36 People who had surgery to match their gender identity were even more likely to be satisfied with their lives, the survey found, with 88% of people who had at least one form of surgery to match their gender identity reporting that they were ""a lot more satisfied"" with their lives. Another 9% of respondents were ""a little more satisfied."" One percent of people said that surgery had no impact, while less than 2% of people said they were a little or a lot less satisfied after undergoing gender-affirming surgery. ""If we want to see improvements in the well-being of transgender people who seek medical care, the biggest opportunities for improvement are earlier engagement with care and more support by society in general,"" Safer said. Despite strides, respondents still struggle with healthcare and workplace mistreatmentWhen it comes to healthcare, almost a quarter of respondents said they did not see a doctor when they needed to in the past year because they were afraid of mistreatment. Of those who did see a healthcare provider in the past year, about half said they had ""at least one negative experience because they were transgender."" Health providers used hard or abusive language and were physically rough or abusive. In some cases patients were misgendered or refused care.In the workplace, more than one in ten people who took the survey said they had been fired, forced to resign, or otherwise lost their job because of their gender identity or expression. The unemployment rate among survey respondents was 18%. Meanwhile, about a third of respondents said they were experiencing poverty, and 30% said they had experienced homelessness at some point in their life. People who responded to the survey said that generally, they experienced harassment and violence because of their gender identity, with nearly one in ten respondents saying that they were denied equal treatment or service in the past year because of their identity or expression. Nearly a third of respondents said they were verbally harassed, while 39% of people said they experienced online harassment. Three percent of people said they were physically attacked in the last year. Four percent of people said they were denied access to a restroom in a public place, at work or in school because of their gender identity in the past year, while 6% of respondents said they had been verbally harassed, physically attacked or experienced unwanted sexual contact when accessing or using a restroom.

HILDEGARD TITUS/AFP via Getty Images Respondents say they experience harassment, discrimination - and move across state lines to avoid it Many respondents said they dealt with some form of discrimination and nearly half said that they had considered moving out of their home state because of proposed or passed legislation targeting transgender people.""The data makes it clear that gender-affirming care helps trans people feel more satisfied with their lives,"" said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, in an email to CBS News. ""And still, we see discriminatory policies in states all around the country that cause real harm by creating barriers to such care."" Nearly half of respondents said they had thought about moving to another state because the government in their home state had ""considered or passed laws that target transgender people for unequal treatment,"" including banning access to bathrooms, health care or sports. Five percent of respondents, or one in 20 people, said they had actually moved because of such legislation. The survey found that the top 10 states that respondents had moved from because of laws targeting transgender people are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Those states were listed in the survey in alphabetical order, not by how many people had moved from them.Forty percent of respondents said they had thought about moving to another area because of discrimination or unequal treatment where they lived, while 10% of respondents had actually moved because of this.Over 92,000 transgender and non-binary people 16 and older in the U.S., U.S. territories and on U.S. military bases overseas were surveyed, and the insights were based on data collected by the National Center for Transgender Equality over six weeks in 2022.

However, the overwhelming majority of them still report more life satisfaction after having transitioned. The National Center for Transgender Equality, or NCTE, one of the country’s largest trans rights organizations, released its 2022 U.S. Transgender Survey Early Insights report Wednesday after a yearslong delay due, in part, to the pandemic. The survey, the most comprehensive look to date at life for transgender people in the U.S., comes as hundreds of bills in the last three years have attempted to roll back trans rights, most often by restricting trans people’s access to transition-related health care and trans students’ abilities to play school sports.“There’s still a drought of information available to lawmakers, the media and advocates regarding our experiences and our needs,” NCTE Executive Director Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen said at a news conference Tuesday. “At best, we’re working in a vacuum of information. At worst, we’re combating dangerous misinformation being spread by anti-trans extremists. Without question, the misinformation and lack of understanding is underpinning these escalating legislative attacks against our community.”A woman attends a rally in support of trans youth in schools on June 26, 2023, outside the Fayette County Public Schools central office in Lexington, Ky.Ryan C. Hermens / Lexington Herald-Leader via Getty Images fileThe organization’s 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey had been the largest survey of trans people in the country, with nearly 28,000 respondents 18 and older, and it has been widely cited, including by Congress and the Supreme Court. Josie Caballero, the director of the survey, said the 2022 iteration more than tripled the number of respondents — with a total of 92,329 from every state and many U.S. territories — and was improved in a number of other ways. For example, it included 605 possible questions (though no respondent received all possible questions), up from 324 in the 2015 survey, and it included more than 8,000 respondents who were 16 and 17. However, study authors note that respondents who participated in the online survey were not drawn from a random sample and that though the sample is large, the findings might not be representative of all trans people. Of the 84,170 adult respondents, 38% identified as nonbinary, 35% identified as transgender women, 25% identified as transgender men and 2% identified as cross-dressers. Continued discrimination and mistreatmentAmong the key findings released Wednesday, the survey found that trans people continue to report experiencing discrimination and mistreatment because of their gender identities and/or expressions.More than one-third of adult respondents, or 34%, were experiencing poverty at the time of the survey, and 18% were unemployed. More than 1 in 10, or 11%, of respondents who had ever held jobs said they had been fired or forced to resign or had lost jobs or been laid off because of their gender identities or expressions. And, in line with previous survey findings, 30% of respondents had experienced homelessness in their lifetimes. Of adult respondents who saw health care providers in the previous 12 months, 48% reported having had at least one negative experience because they were transgender, including being refused health care, having staff members use the incorrect pronouns for them or having providers use abusive language or be physically rough or abusive while treating them. Fear of mistreatment prevented 24% of respondents from seeing doctors when they needed it in the 12 months before the survey. Many respondents also reported past mistreatment in school. Of adult respondents, 80% who were out or perceived as trans in K-12 experienced one or more forms of mistreatment, including verbal harassment, physical attacks, online bullying or being denied use of the restrooms or locker rooms that matched their gender identities. Of the 8,159 respondents who were 16 and 17, 60% reported such mistreatment.Higher life satisfaction after transitionDespite those negative experiences, the vast majority of adult respondents, 79%, who lived at least some of the time in different genders from the ones they were assigned at birth reported that they were “a lot more satisfied” with their lives. An additional 15% reported they were “a little more satisfied.” Respondents who received transition-related medical care reported similarly high rates of satisfaction. Of respondents who were currently receiving hormone treatment, 84% said receiving such treatment for their gender identities/transitions made them “a lot more satisfied” with their lives, and 14% said it made them “a little more satisfied.” Just 1% said hormone treatment made them neither more nor less satisfied, and less than 1% said hormone treatment made them a lot less satisfied.Of respondents who underwent at least one form of gender-affirming surgery, 88% said it made them “a lot more satisfied,” and 9% said it made them a little more satisfied. Less than 2% total said surgery made them a little less or a lot less satisfied. “That might seem obvious to some of us that of course if you’re transgender and you need transition-related health care, of course your life is better off when you get that health care,” Heng-Lehtinen said Tuesday. “But it’s really important to have actually asked people and found out objectively what is their experience, because transition-related health care is otherwise so under attack in state legislatures around the country.”Effects of anti-trans legislationIn the last three years, 23 states have restricted gender-affirming health care — including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries — for minors and, in a few cases, adults, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. Half of states have banned trans student-athletes from playing school sports on the teams that align with their gender identities rather than their assigned sexes at birth, while 10 states have passed laws restricting what bathrooms trans people can use in schools, colleges and/or government-owned buildings.Nearly half of respondents to the latest U.S. Transgender Survey said they had thought about moving to other states because their state governments considered or passed such laws that target transgender people, and 5% — about 4,600 people — said they had actually moved to other states because of such legislation. The top 10 states where trans respondents most often reported moving from were, in alphabetical order, Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.Related stories:From drag bans to sports restrictions, 75 anti-LGBTQ bills became law in 2023 Transgender bathroom bills are back.

Of adult respondents, 67% reported that their immediate families were either supportive or very supportive, while 22% reported they were neither supportive nor unsupportive and 12% reported they were either unsupportive or very unsupportive. Of 16- and 17-year-old respondents, 44% reported that their families were either supportive or very supportive, while 28% reported that they were neither supportive nor unsupportive and 29% reported they were unsupportive or very unsupportive. “It’s important to see that many trans people do have supportive families, since we often hear and see otherwise,” Sandy James, one of the report’s authors, said at Tuesday’s news conference.Heng-Lehtinen said the new data will revolutionize the field of transgender advocacy.“I am confident that the results of the 2022 survey will not only serve as a crucial tool for education, research and policy, but it will catalyze a paradigm shift for the movement for transgender advocacy by empowering advocates with robust and current data regarding our needs and experiences,” he said.

LGBTQ+ Largest ever survey of transgender Americans shows high satisfaction with gender transition by: Cora Neas Posted: Feb 9, 2024 / 03:21 PM CST Updated: Feb 9, 2024 / 05:58 PM CST by: Cora Neas Posted: Feb 9, 2024 / 03:21 PM CST Updated: Feb 9, 2024 / 05:58 PM CST SHARE AUSTIN (KXAN) — The research team behind the 2022 U.S. Trans Survey (USTS) released a report of its early findings on Wednesday, presenting the largest single sampling of transgender people by any survey, with over 92,000 respondents. The survey follows up on the National Center for Transgender Equality’s (NCTE) 2015 survey, which had nearly 28,000 responses. The 2022 survey also permitted responses from 16 and 17-year-olds. NCTE’s Director of the USTS, Josie Caballero, spoke with KXAN in 2022 about the survey’s launch. “It fills in some of the large gaps in research about trans people, and it provides a critical tool for researchers, policymakers and advocates seeking to better understand the needs of trans people,” said Caballero in 2022. 2022: U.S. Trans Survey seeks accurate picture of transgender life in America According to early results from the 2022 survey, 94% of respondents said they were more satisfied with life after gender transitioning, and 3% reported decreased satisfaction. For transgender people receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT), 98% reported higher life satisfaction; for those who had received transition-related surgery, 97%. KXAN followed up with Caballero about the early results on Friday. “I believe that [life satisfaction] is probably the most important finding because it just validates the fact that transitional care improves trans lives,” Caballero said. “We hope for detailed analysis to grow our continued knowledge of the gaps in research that we have experienced.” Despite increased life satisfaction, transgender people report negative experiences in public life: 48% reported a negative experience or were refused service by a health care provider; 34% reported they were experiencing poverty (U.S. average 11.5%), and 30% had experienced homelessness; 18% were unemployed (U.S. average 3.7%), and 11% reported losing a job because they came out; and, 60% of 16- and 17-year-old respondents said school staff, teachers and peers had mistreated them due to their gender identity. 2022: Homeless Transgender people face higher violence, fewer resources in Austin It saves lives, it improves the quality of life when people feel accepted and encouraged to be themselves. Josie Caballero, U.S. Trans Survey Director Texas was named by the report as one of ten states that respondents reported leaving because of state laws targeting them. “Trans people are pretty much distributed exactly like the actual population of the American public across the country via the census,” Caballero said. “This was before 2023 when we saw 500+ pieces of legislation that were targeting trans and queer people across the country; currently, we are tracking over 300 bills just this year. So we can only assume that the problem is getting worse and more people are actually following through with the migration.” OutLaw: A Half-Century Criminalizing LGBTQ+ Texans The survey team plans to make a more comprehensive report and state-specific reports available later this year. “We hope with the extra data… researchers are going to be able to actually dig in deeper, to find better questions to ask,” Caballero said. “We’re also hoping that our data set will be a better educational tool for policymakers… that they’re able to cite this information as hard evidence to show the benefits and barriers that transgender people face in the United States.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Released on Wednesday (8 February), the National Center for Transgender Equality’s (NCTE) 2022 US Transgender Survey compiled data from 92,329 trans people from all 50 states, as well as overseas territories and dependencies and military personnel serving outside the country – making it one of the largest studies ever conducted. Asking people about healthcare, family, education, gender identity and transition, it found that almost all respondents (94 per cent) who lived “at least some of the time in a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth” reported that they were either “a lot more satisfied” (79 per cent ) or “a little more satisfied” (15 per cent) with life. Meanwhile, 98 per cent reported that receiving hormone treatment made them either “a lot more satisfied” (84 per cent) or “a little more satisfied” (14 per cent). Family support was also fairly prevalent, with about two-thirds of transgender adults saying family members were either ‘supportive’ or ‘highly supportive’ of their trans identity. Only eight per cent said immediate family was unsupportive and just four cent reported “very unsupportive” families. The survey also showed the real-life impact of transphobia in the US, however: 47 per cent of respondents had considered moving to another state because their local government considered passing, or had passed, laws that target transgender people for unequal treatment, such as banning access to toilets, healthcare and sports. Five per cent of those who replied had already relocated to escape such laws. You may like to watch The top 10 states from which respondents moved away from were Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. In addition, 47 per cent of respondents reported that they would feel “very uncomfortable” asking the police for help if they needed it, with only eight per cent feeling “very comfortable”. The number of “very uncomfortable” or “somewhat uncomfortable” respondents rose to 62 per cent if the issue was about their trans identity.

Co-principal investigator and lead researcher Sandy E James said: “It’s impactful to see so many trans people report life satisfaction when they live according to their gender identity and get the health care they need, but we also see that trans people face substantial barriers to living full, healthy and authentic lives. “As the most comprehensive source of data about trans people in the US, these findings fill an important gap in our knowledge and serve as a critical resource for understanding and addressing the needs of trans people.” And Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, an executive director at NCTE, said: “Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and fairness. We need laws at federal and state level that make sure all people – including trans people – are treated fairly. “No one should ever face discrimination in employment, housing, health care, education [or] other areas of life just because of who they are.” Dec 06 2023 20 stars who came out as LGBTQ+ in 2023 More: transition transphobia Queer News.

214,94% of trans people happier following their transition according to totally legit online survey sponsored by trans advocacy group.,"For the trans activists who have watched in dismay as their narrative has crumbled before their eyes, here comes the cavalry to the rescue!",Right,Mixed Factuality,,https://notthebee.com/article/94-of-trans-people-happier-following-their-transition-according-to-totally-legit-online-survey-sponsored-by-trans-advocacy-group?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral,," Social Takes Shop Discover Join Join Login Social Podcasts Shop Discover 94% of trans people happier following their transition according to totally legit online survey sponsored by trans advocacy group. · Feb 11, 2024 · NottheBee.com For the trans activists who have watched in dismay as their narrative has crumbled before their eyes, here comes the cavalry to the rescue!Too bad for them it's F-Troop.No matter, the media powers were all too eager to fall in line and report on the survey as if it were a legitimate study sponsored by dispassionate researchers interested in pursuing the truth and not a marketing piece sponsored by The National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) a self-proclaimed advocacy group interested in pursuing a narrative.It had to be legit, right? Why, it was the ""biggest survey ever!""The Guardian clearly can't get enough of this having published a different survey last year which showed only 78% were happier.Why, trans people are getting happier by the minute!Interestingly, that older survey was made up of nearly two-thirds of people who called themselves ""trans non-binary"" or ""trans gender-nonconforming"" meaning... what? You transitioned to not a gender? Is that a half trans? What if you trans from non-binary to gender-nonconforming? Are you transtrans?Don't worry, they are as confused as you are.Moreover, less than a third were on hormone therapy and half that had had surgery, meaning the vast majority of respondents were playing dress-up more than anything else.No matter, this latest super-scientific survey ups the ante in the endless race to be the most supportive.How super-scientific was it?It employed that gold standard of all surveys:The celebrity endorsement.And not just any celebrity endorsement, but endorsements from celebrities with an enormous pro-trans following.The US Trans Survey is LIVE! If you are a trans person over the age of 16, go to ustranssurvey.org and take the survey now.When it comes to data integrity, you can keep your random probability sampling; give me an Instagram post targeting people who already agree with you any day.And yes, 16 is the cutoff, two years younger than the last NCTE survey.The study included individuals aged 16 and older at the time of survey completion.The smart money says it will be even lower the next time.I downloaded the preliminary results available via PDF.The survey was supported by a number of trans advocacy groups all divided and categorized by race because if you aren't practicing overt segregation, you're doing intersectionality wrong.And you're a racist, but that's assumed.They were careful to reach out to a broad array of groups representing everybody from those who support the cause wholeheartedly, to those who support the cause even more wholeheartedly.The outreach period began approximately one year before the survey launch, and the outreach team used various strategies to connect with transgender people through multiple points of access, such as through transgender - or LGBTQ -, support groups, health centers, and online communities.The people hanging around the groups that explicitly support the trans industrial complex are probably not the ones who either regret their transition or have already detransitioned.It would be like running a survey about abortion targeting Planned Parenthood members or a poll on putting pineapple on pizza by only asking psychopaths.You're going to get the result you wanted.Throughout the outreach period, the team conducted a survey pledge campaign, which was among the most important methods for engaging and communicating with potential respondents.Just to be crystal clear: They recruited the most committed advocates to pledge fealty to the cause and recruit the like-minded.This wasn't a study. This was a pep rally.The campaign invited potential participants and allies to pledge to take the survey and/or spread the word about the survey.And allies? Hold that thought for just a second.The survey was anonymous, and maintaining privacy and confidentiality in the collection and maintenance of survey data was an important component of preserving participants' anonymity.Anonymous? So ... anyone could take the survey, including ""allies"" eager to support the cause?I swear, could this survey get any more legitimate? All it needs now is a sweepstakes!As an incentive to complete the survey, participants were offered the opportunity to enter into a random drawing for one of three cash prizes upon completion of the survey, including one $500 cash prize and two $250 cash prizes.The report didn't mention what percentage were taking hormones, had surgery, or unhappy childhoods (that last one was 46% in the Washington Post survey). Not to worry!A detailed description of the methodology will be included in the full report of the 2022 U.S. Transgender Survey.After the headlines, attention, and scrutiny die down.I have no idea what percentage of trans people are happier following their transition, and this survey certainly doesn't tell me either. It is comically bad and corrupt from the start. That our alleged watchdogs in the media would slavishly report on it as if it was anything other than a slickly produced advertising brochure tells you everything you need to know about them.Look, if you're going to gaslight me, at least show me some respect and make it look half believable.

Starmer welcomed Esther Ghey to the Commons on Wednesday and praised her “unwavering bravery” before asking Sunak a question about NHS waiting lists.In response the prime minister listed what he called broken Labour promises, telling the Commons: “I think I counted almost 30 in the last year: pensions, planning, peerages, public sector pay, tuition fees, childcare, second referendums, defining a woman – although in fairness that was only 99% of a U-turn.”The jibe drew cries of “shame” from opposition MPs, who called for Sunak to apologise. A visibly angry Starmer responded: “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in the chamber.”Brianna’s father, Peter Spooner, said Sunak’s remark was “absolutely dehumanising” and called for him to apologise. “For the prime minister of our country to come out with degrading comments like he did, regardless of them being in relation to discussions in parliament, they are absolutely dehumanising,” he told Sky News.Facing questions about the controversy on Thursday morning, Philp declined six times on BBC Breakfast to say whether he thought Sunak’s jibe was appropriate or respectful.Asked whether he was suggesting that Brianna’s father had misunderstood the prime minister’s remark, Philp said he was “very sad” to read Spooner’s response and added: “I have got every respect for, obviously, the views and feelings of a bereaved father.”He insisted that the prime minister was making a political point about Labour and that Starmer was “actually wrong” to bring up Brianna after Sunak’s remark.“It is of course important to conduct public debate respectfully,” Philp told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. “That is why I think it was actually wrong of Keir Starmer to introduce Brianna as a subject in the next question, because Rishi Sunak had not made any reference to any individuals.”Sunak has offered to meet Esther Ghey but no meeting has been publicly confirmed.Although some Conservative MPs have criticised Sunak’s remark, the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, accused Starmer of trying to use Brianna’s murder for “political point-scoring”.Philp told Times Radio: “The point the prime minister was making was about flip-flops and U-turns, and he listed about 10 different flip-flops and U-turns that Keir Starmer’s made – he’s making another one, I understand, later on today, on this £28bn that seems to be vanishing or is being U-turned, or they’re saying they can do the policy without it costing anything, or some similar nonsense.”“So, the PM was trying to highlight Keir Starmer’s flip-flops and U-turns, and that I think was an understandable thing to do.”“As a more general point, when talking about difficult and sensitive issues, it is obviously important for everyone in public life, all of us – journalists, politicians, everybody – just to use measured and respectful language.”Explore more on these topicsRishi SunakTransgenderPMQsHouse of CommonsnewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyGreen party incorrectly sacked spokesperson in part over trans rights views, court rules9 Feb 2024Sunak refuses to apologise to Brianna Ghey’s father over PMQs trans jibe8 Feb 2024Brianna Ghey’s father demands apology from Sunak over transgender remark7 Feb 2024Whether driven by Sunak’s callousness or clumsiness, trans jibe is PM’s new normal7 Feb 2024Starmer condemns Sunak over trans rights jibe during PMQs visit by Brianna Ghey’s mother7 Feb 2024Trans people in England more likely to have long-term poor mental health – study1 Feb 2024UN envoy criticises ‘one-sided’ WHO approach to trans health guidelines9 Jan 2024What does the trans guidance for England’s schools say?20 Dec 2023Trans guidance tells English schools to consider social media influence on pupils asking to transition19 Dec 2023Most viewedMost viewedUKWorldClimate crisisUkraineFootballNewslettersBusinessEnvironmentUK politicsEducationSocietyScienceTechGlobal developmentObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

During a grilling on BBC Breakfast, Policing Minister Chris Philp struggled to defend the PM's comments as he was repeatedly quizzed by host Naga Munchetty. It came as the PM resisted calls to apologise for the remark on Wednesday as the mother of murdered transgender teenager Brianna Ghey visited Parliament. At the beginning of PMQs, Keir Starmer praised Esther Ghey's ""unwavering bravery"" just days after two teenagers were jailed for killing her 16-year-old daughter last year. But just minutes later, Mr Sunak accused Mr Starmer of failing to stand by his commitments and U-turning on ""defining a woman"". “Although, in fairness, that was only 99% of a U-turn,” he joked as he referenced comments the Labour leader previously made when he said 99.9% of women don’t have male genitalia. As Tory MPs howled with laughter, Mr Starmer said: ""Of all the weeks to say that when Brianna's mother is in this chamber - shame."" Asked whether the joke was ""appropriate"" while Esther was in Parliament, the policing minister Chris Philp claimed on BBC Breakfast: ""The PM wasn't talking about trans issues. If you can't see the poll, click here ""He certainly wasn't talking about Brianna in that passage. He was talking about Keir Starmer's record of U-turns on a whole range of different issues."" Pressed again on whether the remark was ""respectful"", Mr Philp again said the PM was highlighting U-turns from the Labour leader. In total, the Tory minister deflected the question six times and refused to say whether the comments were respectful. He added: ""The Prime Minister made no reference at all to any individual trans people. It was Keir Starmer who introduced that. The Prime Minister was making a point about Labour's very numerous flip-flops."" Last night, Brianna's father also demanded Mr Sunak apologise for the ""degrading"" remarks. Peter Spooner told Sky News: "" Identities of people should not be used in that manner, and I personally feel shocked by his comments and feel he should apologise for his remarks."" Asked about the comments, Mr Philp said: ""I think anyone who is interested in this issue should actually listen to the clip, listen to the initial exchange."" Pressed on whether he was suggesting Brianna's father Mr Spooner had misunderstood the Prime Minister's comments, Mr Philp said: ""I have got every respect for, obviously, the views and feelings of a bereaved father."" TV presenter Carol Vorderman said on Wednesday: "" Rishi Sunak should immediately resign for his sick joke mocking trans people when he knew that Brianna Ghey ’s mother was in the Houses of Parliament. The fact that the Tory benches sat laughing like a pack of hyenas tells you everything you need to know about this party.” The LGBT+ charity Stonewall added: “We call on the Prime Minister to apologise unreservedly for his comments, and for him to reflect on how careless words from those in power can and do result in harm.""

The Prime Minister made the comments as Esther Ghey, the mum of murdered trans teenager Brianna Ghey, watched on from the public gallery. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer slammed Mr Sunak for the remark as he said: ""Of all the weeks to say that... Shame. Parading as man of integrity when he's got absolutely no responsibility.""

What he was doing in the first exchange was talking about a number of flip flops and u-turns that Keir Starmer has executed in a whole number of different areas."" However, the hosts were forced to step in and insisted the clip has already been played for viewers. Brianna Ghey's dad, Peter Spooner, slammed Mr Sunak's comments and said they ""degrading"" and ""absolutely dehumanising"". Ben grilled Mr Philp on why the Prime Minister has yet to apologise for the trans jibe as he said: ""The question we're asking is once the Prime Minister has realised something he has said has offended her family and is considered disrespectful, why can't he just apologise for that specific thing."" He added: ""Do you think politicians shouldn't apologise? Do you think it's a sign of weakness?"" However, Mr Philp continued to insist the Prime Minister didn't need to apologise as the comment was aimed at the Labour leader. He said: ""You're just saying make an apology to get through a media day. You need to view these things quite carefully and in a balanced way."" Ben stepped in at this point as he said: ""But you could talk about how sensitive it is though, particularly in light of the guest that was going to be in Parliament that day. "" Mr Philp added: ""I do understand the point and that's why he made a warm tribute a few minutes later."" Viewers following the exchange on social media platform X slammed Mr Philp's response. A viewer named Gaz Smith said: ""Painful to watch."" Nick_Unit added: ""Chris Philp, another Tory MP, wheeled out on TV to make a pathetic attempt at defending Sunak.

Host Naga Munchetty relentlessly questioned an increasingly uncomfortable Philp as she asked him to clarify his position on whether the Prime Minister’s remarks were deemed “respectful” or “appropriate,” especially in the sensitive context of the presence of Esther Ghey, the mother of murdered transgender teenager Brianna Ghey, in Parliament. Sunak was attacking Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer for reversing his stance on different policy positions. Philp defended Sunak: “I think he was talking about Labour’s and Keir Starmer’s flip-flops and U-turns.” The host asked again: “Do you think it was respectful to talk about Keir Starmer’s views on trans people at that time? Do you think it was respectful?” “He was talking about Labour’s policy flip-flops, and that is a reasonable thing to do,” the minister replied. “The Prime Minister made no reference at all to any individual trans people. It was Keir Starmer who introduced that. The Prime Minister was making a point about Labour’s very numerous flip-flops, another one of which we’re seeing today.” Munchetty raised the statement issued by Ghey’s father, Peter Spooner, who demanded an apology from Sunak for the “degrading” comments. “Is Peter Spooner, the father of Brianna Ghey, going to get an apology from Rishi Sunak?” she asked. Philp replied: “Well, I was very, very sad to read or to hear about those comments from Brianna’s father yesterday when he made those. As I say, I think anyone who is interested in this issue should actually listen to the clip. Listen to the initial exchange yesterday.” “So are you saying Peter Spooner has misunderstood what Rishi Sunak has said?” the host pressed. The minister continued: “Look, I’ve got every respect for obviously the views and feelings of a bereaved father.” “Do you think he deserves an apology?” Munchetty returned. “Look, I think people should listen to the clip, form their own view,” the minister said. Munchetty became more pointed in her question: “He has listened to the clip. I cannot imagine that the father of a child who was murdered a year ago this Sunday has not listened to that clip and I think it’s quite disingenuous for you to suggest he hasn’t. He’s asked for an apology, do you think he’ll get one?” The Tory MP attempted to clarify: “I did not… that’s… I did not for a second suggest that. I’m saying that people who want…” The host pushed one more time: “My question to you was about whether Peter Spooner would get an apology, not about people listening to the clip.” Philp repeated his line: “Okay look, I’ve already said repeatedly that the prime minister made no reference to any individual, uh, in his remarks yesterday.” Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com Filed Under: BBC BreakfastChris PhilpKeir StarmerPeter SpoonerRishi Sunak Previous PostNext Post Previous PostNext Post Load Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Their January post urging people to meet “waterwoman” Sasha Lowerson, a biological man in a bikini, lit a literal fire under fans, who took to the internet to burn everything from surf booties to boards.Days after deleting the reel, with international outrage at a peak, headquarters decided to do something that Bud Light still hasn’t: apologize.In a revealing move, management issued a mea culpa late Wednesday night, just five days into the dustup. “Our recent post has landed us in the divisive space around transgender participation in competitive sport,” a spokesman told Shop-Eat-Surf late Wednesday night. “We want to promote surfing for everyone in a respectful way, but recognize we upset a lot of people with our post and for that, we are sorry. To clarify, the surfer featured has not replaced anyone on the Rip Curl team and is not a sponsored athlete.”If Americans want to know who’s winning the war with corporate bullies, look no further! A reversal like this is majorly significant — not only because of how intense the backlash was, but how quickly executives responded. If anything, the wave of corporate pushback that was sparked by Bud Light has only intensified over time. In fact, it’s so powerful that even the media is starting to admit that the grassroots may actually be winning this fight. “Big corporates may finally be learning that ‘Go woke, go broke’ is real,” commentator Nicolle Flint pointed out. “… [T]he once iconic Australian surf brand is living proof that women are finally fighting back against companies using transgender women to promote products for women and girls,” she wrote. “What is most significant about the Rip Curl campaign featuring Sasha Lowerson that was removed from Instagram just five days after being posted, is that this is the first time a major brand has responded to female backlash … Whether the company ‘woke up’ soon enough to the fact that the backlash from women was serious and potentially financially damaging remains to be seen.”That’s a blow to the company’s relatively new CEO, who, pre-Bud Light, told The Sydney Morning Herald when she was hired in 2021 that her goal was to drift left. “You still want to be cool enough to recruit that next generation,” Brooke Farris said, “but I think by approaching it from a place of inclusivity, people will be attracted to that.”Turns out, people were not attracted to that — and willing to sink her brand to prove it. Meanwhile, Bethany Hamilton, the courageous face of Rip Curl from 1999 to 2023, is surely looking on with satisfaction. A year into her renewed contract with the company, the two sides abruptly parted ways last year, almost certainly because of Hamilton’s opposition to the new rules allowing biological men to compete in women’s surfing. The devoted Christian and shark-attack survivor, whose comeback story inspired the world, reiterated her stand at the height of the Rip Curl controversy, posting, “Male bodied athletes should not be competing in women’s sports. Period.”Amazingly, those mainstream views have still made Hamilton a public target. Most recently, a mob of LGBT activists tried — and failed — to have Bethany disinvited from a speaking engagement at a Wisconsin fundraiser for underserved girls. In a three-page missive signed by 200 trans allies, they demand that the Women’s Fund of the Oshkosh Area Community Foundation take “all possible steps to remove and replace Bethany Hamilton as ‘Power of the Purse’ keynote speaker” lest she creates more “discrimination, distrust, division, and harm.”In another sign that activists are fighting a losing battle, the Foundation refused to be intimidated. Leaders released a statement to local outlet WHBY insisting the event will go on as planned. “Over the years, the Women’s Fund Power of the Purse event has hosted a wide range of powerful speakers from all backgrounds whose diverse experiences and perspectives have imparted impactful lessons of hope, and perseverance — and Bethany Hamilton is no different. Both a world-renowned athlete and survivor, Ms. Hamilton will share her own story with our community of overcoming obstacles, facing fears and triumphing as an individual. Although her scheduled appearance has been met with some criticism due to her reported personal views on transgender athletes … we still very much believe her inspirational message of determination and resilience can transcend our differences.”For a corporate culture used to flaunting its extremism without consequences, Rip Curl’s regret proves one thing: there are choppy waters ahead for woke business.Originally published at The Washington Stand.

Shame. Parading as a man of integrity, when he’s got absolutely no responsibility.”View image in fullscreenPeter Spooner said: ‘Identities of people should not be used in that manner.’ Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersSunak ignored several demands from MPs in the Commons that he apologise, saying only that Esther Ghey represented “the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity, and she deserves all our admiration and praise.”No 10 defended his words, saying it was “legitimate” to note U-turns by the opposition.It is understood that while Sunak made the comments after being told that Ghey was watching, she actually arrived in chamber slightly late and so missed that initial exchange.00:01:27Starmer condemns Sunak comment on trans people as Brianna Ghey's mother watches in gallery – videoBrianna, 16, was lured to a park in Cheshire and murdered in February last year. Last Friday, Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both 16, were jailed for at least 22 and 20 years respectively. Ratcliffe was found to have been partly motivated by hostility to Brianna’s transgender identity.It emerged later that No 10 was trying to arrange a meeting between Sunak and Brianna’s family, at a time to suit them, to discuss online safety among young people, one of several issues that have come to the fore from her murder.While some colleagues leapt to Sunak’s defence – the business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, tweeted that it was “shameful of Starmer to link his own inability to be clear on the matter of sex and gender directly to her grief” – several Tory MPs expressed disquiet.The former minister Jackie Doyle-Price said that while she was an advocate of balancing transgender rights with the protection of single-sex spaces, Sunak’s comment “trivialises something that’s very important” and was “frankly very ill-judged”.She told Times Radio: “I suspect that when he says that line, he doesn’t think about it like that because it’s being given to him as a line. Let’s just bring it down to its lowest level – you know, boys like talking about penises.”Dehenna Davison, another former minister, tweeted that it was “disappointing to hear jokes being made at the trans community’s expense”, adding: “Our words in the house resonate right across our society and we all need to remember that.”She wrote: “Given some of the terrible incidences of transphobia we have seen lately, this need for respect feels more crucial than ever.”View image in fullscreenBrianna Ghey, 16, was murdered by two teenagers last year, at least one of whom was found to have been partly motivated by her transgender identity.Jamie Wallis, the Conservative backbencher who in 2022 became the UK’s first publicly trans MP, also expressed disappointment at Sunak’s words.He said in a statement: “I know that from my own interactions with the prime minister that today’s display of insensitivity must have been inadvertent. Today has been a tough day for me, but all I can think about right now is Brianna’s mother. Let us all think of her as we choose how to progress with this debate.”While Downing Street clearly hopes the row will die down, it has the potential to create more difficulties, with the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, enduring some awkward exchanges in TV interviews intended to be devoted to a Treasury analysis of Labour’s green prosperity plan.Asked repeatedly why Sunak had made a joke at the expense of trans people, the chancellor told the BBC this was “taking these comments out of context”, before eventually refusing to engage with questions about whether the prime minister should apologise.A Labour spokesperson said: “We don’t think that the country wants or deserves a prime minister that is happy to use minorities as a punchbag. The comments were really deeply offensive to trans people and he should reflect on his response there and apologise.”Starmer held a meeting with Esther Ghey in parliament after PMQs. He later tweeted: “I am utterly in awe of her strength and bravery in the face of such unimaginable grief, as she campaigns to make sure no parent has to go through what she did.”Sunak and his ministers routinely attack Labour’s position on transgender rights. Last year the party changed its policy on a self-identification system that would have let people officially change their gender without a medical diagnosis.Explore more on these topicsRishi SunakConservativesTransgenderPMQsHouse of CommonsnewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyGreen party incorrectly sacked spokesperson in part over trans rights views, court rules9 Feb 2024Sunak refuses to apologise to Brianna Ghey’s father over PMQs trans jibe8 Feb 2024Minister defends Sunak’s transgender jibe amid calls for apology8 Feb 2024Whether driven by Sunak’s callousness or clumsiness, trans jibe is PM’s new normal7 Feb 2024Starmer condemns Sunak over trans rights jibe during PMQs visit by Brianna Ghey’s mother7 Feb 2024Trans people in England more likely to have long-term poor mental health – study1 Feb 2024UN envoy criticises ‘one-sided’ WHO approach to trans health guidelines9 Jan 2024What does the trans guidance for England’s schools say?20 Dec 2023Trans guidance tells English schools to consider social media influence on pupils asking to transition19 Dec 2023Most viewedMost viewedUKWorldClimate crisisUkraineFootballNewslettersBusinessEnvironmentUK politicsEducationSocietyScienceTechGlobal developmentObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Shame.”Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the Labour leader said: “This is nothing to do with me. This is Brianna’s father. They’ve had their child murdered and he has put his words out about what the Prime Minister said and it’s not good enough for the Prime Minister’s team to go out today and effectively say to Brianna’s father ‘you didn’t understand what Rishi was saying’.“He did understand.

During his weekly showdown with MPs and the leader of the opposition in the House of Commons, Mr Sunak said: said: ""We are bringing the waiting lists down for the longest waiters and making progress, but it is a bit rich to hear about promises from someone who has broken every single promise he was elected on. ""I think I have counted almost 30 in the last year. Pensions, planning, peerages, public sector pay, tuition fees, childcare, second referendums, defining a woman - although in fairness that was only 99% of a U-turn."" The dad of murdered trans girl Brianna, Peter Spooner, said Mr Sunak's remarks during PMQs, which the girl's mother Esther Ghey attended, were ""degrading"" and ""absolutely dehumanising"". Mr Spooner said: ""As the prime minister for our country to come out with degrading comments like he did, regardless of them being in relation to discussions in parliament, they are absolutely dehumanising. Identities of people should not be used in that manner, and I personally feel shocked by his comments and feel he should apologise for his remarks."" The dad told Sky News the PM should ""apologise for his remarks"", regardless of them ""being in relation to discussions in Parliament"". Campaigners also accused Mr Sunak of being “callous” as he refused to apologise and Downing Street insisted his remarks were “legitimate”. If you can't see the poll, click here At a briefing for journalists, No10 six times refused to apologise. Mr Sunak’s Press Secretary insisted it was ""legitimate"" to point out Mr Starmer's ""U-turns"". Sir Keir Starmer has previously said that 99.9% of women ""haven't got a penis"". Brianna’s family has now been invited to meet with Mr Sunak and Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan about online safety, it is understood. No10 refuses six times to apologise for Rishi Sunak's trans joke as Brianna Ghey's mum visits Commons Brianna Ghey is pictured with her mother, Esther, who was at PMQs today Ms Ghey is campaigning for new rules on social media for kids following the murder of 16-year-old Brianna and met MPs today. At the beginning of Prime Minister’s Questions, Sir Keir praised her ""unwavering bravery"" just days after two teenagers were locked up for the murder of her daughter last year. But just minutes later, Mr Sunak accused the Labour leader of failing to stand by his commitments and U-turning on ""defining a woman"". In response, Sir Keir said: ""Of all the weeks to say that when Brianna's mother is in this chamber - shame. Parading as a man of integrity when he's got absolutely no responsibility."" Other MPs also shouted ""shame"" while one could be heard saying: ""Disgusting.” Ms Ghey who had been due to watch PMQs arrived in the gallery of the House of Commons chamber shortly after the exchange. Labour MP Liz Twist later asked the PM whether he ""could consider apologising"" to Brianna's mother for his ""insensitive comment"", but he declined. Keir Starmer later met Ms Ghey in his Commons office and said he was ""in awe of her strength"". Rishi Sunak faces criticism over his remarks about transgender people ( Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag) It comes just days after Mr Sunak was criticised for being ""callous"" after agreeing to a £1,000 bet with Piers Morgan he would deport asylum seekers to Rwanda before the election. A spokesman for the Labour leader added: ""We don’t think the country wants or deserves a Prime Minister who is happy to use minorities as a punch bag. His comments were deeply offensive to trans people and he should reflect on his response and apologise.” TV presenter Carol Vorderman said: ""Rishi Sunak should immediately resign for his sick joke mocking trans people when he knew that Brianna Ghey’s mother was in the Houses of Parliament. The fact that the Tory benches sat laughing like a pack of hyenas tells you everything you need to know about this party.” The LGBT+ charity Stonewall said: “We call on the Prime Minister to apologise unreservedly for his comments, and for him to reflect on how careless words from those in power can and do result in harm."" Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper MP added: ""Every day, Sunak just sinks lower and lower. His behaviour is appalling and deeply disturbing, but it's hard to be shocked by this lack of empathy from a man who bets on asylum seekers' lives. ""People are not a punchline - and it's long overdue that the Prime Minister learns that. The British public, and Brianna's mother, deserve so much more than this."" Speaking to Sky News, in response to the criticism, Mr Sunak's press secretary said: ""If you look back on what the prime minister was saying, there was a long list of U-turns that the leader of the opposition had been making. ""I don't think those U-turns are a joke, it is quite serious changes in public policy. I think it is totally legitimate for the prime minister to point those out."" Keir Starmer, pictured with Esther Ghey in the House of Commons today, praised the mum's bravery ( Image: Getty Images) Since the court case finished last week, Ms Ghey has received plaudits for her campaign work and is calling for a law to ensure phones are ""suitable"" for kids. She is urging MPs to adopt a ban on social media apps on smartphones for under 16s and also wants software to alert parents when their children are searching harmful content online. Scarlett Jenkinson, who was locked up for life last week alongside Eddie Ratcliffe, had viewed extreme violence on the ""dark web"" before murdering Brianna. On Wednesday Ms Ghey also attended a Westminster Hall debate on mindfulness in schools alongside her local MP for Warrington North, Charlotte Nichols. Last year, Ms Ghey set up the Peace of Mind campaign to help raise cash to train teachers in mindfulness techniques and help kids deal with negative emotions. She has previously said creating the campaign helped her ""focus on something positive"" and has meant ""something good has come out of the tragic situation.""Most Read Don't Miss FollowMirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ONBrianna GheyBreaking NewsHouse of CommonsTransgenderRishi SunakGet UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxSign upInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

Peter Spooner said he was “shocked” by the comment made during Prime Minister’s Questions, in which the PM accused Sir Keir Starmer of having difficulty in “defining a woman”. The remarks have prompted an immediate backlash, but Mr Sunak has refused to apologise, with Downing Street later insisting the comments were “totally legitimate” and denying they were transphobic. Try MEN Premium now for FREE... just click here to give it a go Mr Spooner told Sky News: “As the Prime Minister for our country to come out with degrading comments like he did, regardless of them being in relation to discussions in Parliament, they are absolutely dehumanising. Identities of people should not be used in that manner, and I personally feel shocked by his comments and feel he should apologise for his remarks.” In response to his call for an apology, Government minister Laura Trott denied the remarks had been a “joke” and insisted they had “absolutely nothing to do with this appalling tragedy”. However, it is understood Brianna’s family has now been invited to a meeting about online safety – which her mother, Esther Ghey, is campaigning to improve – with the Prime Minister and Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan. In an exchange with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Sunak said: “We are bringing the waiting lists down for the longest waiters and making progress, but it is a bit rich to hear about promises from someone who has broken every single promise he was elected on. “I think I have counted almost 30 in the last year. Pensions, planning, peerages, public sector pay, tuition fees, childcare, second referendums, defining a woman – although in fairness, that was only 99% of a U-turn.” Sir Keir, who met Brianna’s mother, Esther Ghey, on Wednesday, condemned the Prime Minister’s remark, with a chorus of opposition backbenchers calling out: “Shame.” “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in this chamber. Shame,” Sir Keir said. “Parading as a man of integrity when he’s got absolutely no responsibility.” Number 10 declined repeatedly to apologise for Mr Sunak’s language and said it was part of a “legitimate” criticism of Labour. Mr Sunak’s press secretary said: “If you look back on what the Prime Minister was saying, there was a long list of U-turns that the leader of the opposition had been making. I don’t think those U-turns are a joke, it is quite serious changes in public policy. I think it is totally legitimate for the Prime Minister to point those out.” “It is clearly part of what happens in the chamber, at Prime Minister’s Questions, to point out the U-turns an opposition leader has made,” she added. Within the session, Mr Sunak also faced calls to apologise from Labour MP Liz Twist, to which he did not directly respond. But, concluding Prime Minister’s Questions, he said: “If I could just say also to Brianna Ghey’s mother who is here, as I said earlier this week, what happened was an unspeakable and shocking tragedy. Brianna Ghey's father, Peter Spooner, has demanded an apology from Rishi Sunak (Image: Manchester Evening News) ""As I said earlier this week, in the face of that, for her mother to demonstrate the compassion and empathy that she did last weekend, I thought demonstrated the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity. She deserves all our admiration and praise for that.” Mr Sunak faced some criticism even from within his party ranks over the comment. Former Tory business minister, Jackie Doyle-Price, said it was “careless” and “very ill-judged” for him to use the joke “in that context”, but also accused critics of having “weaponised” it. “I find this pre-rehearsed line on this issue really trivialises something that’s very important so I’ve become more uncomfortable with that,” she told Times Radio. “To say it in that context was just, frankly, very ill-judged, but I was equally uncomfortable with the way that it was weaponised. “And I just think what an ugly situation all around, because, you know, there is a dead child here who’s been murdered in the most appalling circumstances. And for that to be the exchanges in the in the chamber of the House of Commons, it’s just not my proudest moment to be a Member of Parliament I must say.” Former junior minister Dehenna Davison, in a post on X, formerly Twitter, said it was “disappointing to hear jokes being made at the trans community’s expense” and warned that “our words in the House resonate right across our society”. The Bishop Auckland MP, who was not in the chamber on Wednesday, said: “As politicians, it’s our job to take the heat out of such debates and focus on finding sensible ways forward, whilst ensuring those involved are treated with respect. Given some of the terrible incidences of transphobia we have seen lately, this need for respect feels more crucial than ever.” Cabinet ministers defended their party leader in the wake of the exchange, with Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch accusing Labour of trying to “weaponise” the issue. Ms Badenoch, who is also Equalities Minister, said on X: “Every murder is a tragedy. None should be trivialised by political point-scoring. As a mother, I can imagine the trauma that Esther Ghey has endured. It was shameful of Starmer to link his own inability to be clear on the matter of sex and gender directly to her grief.” Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also told ITV News: “It was the most appalling tragedy and I think everyone has been incredibly struck by the courage and resolve of Brianna’s mother, Esther, throughout the whole of this terrible, terrible story. “And we should also be clear, the Prime Minister was not talking about that; he was talking about the fact that Keir Starmer has changed his position on that, as on many other issues.” This is not the first time the Prime Minister has attacked Labour over the issue of gender identity policies, which have been a frequent subject of debate in Westminster in recent years. LGBT+ campaigners have condemned some of the language used by politicians to discuss transgender people, with the issue often drawn into the so-called “culture war” by right-wingers. In his Tory conference speech last year, Mr Sunak told Conservative delegates in Manchester: “We shouldn’t get bullied into believing that people can be any sex they want to be. They can’t – a man is a man and a woman is a woman.” A Labour spokeswoman called on Mr Sunak to apologise. “We don’t think the country wants or deserves a Prime Minister that is happy to use minorities as a punchbag,” she said. LGBT+ charity Stonewall called Mr Sunak’s words “cheap, callous and crass”. A spokesperson said: “The disrespect and dehumanisation of trans people that we see played out daily in the media and in our political discourse has real-life consequences and it has to stop. We call on the Prime Minister to apologise unreservedly for his comments, and for him to reflect on how careless words from those in power can and do result in harm.”Story SavedYou can find this story in My Bookmarks.Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.Follow Manchester Evening NewsFacebookTwitterMore OnBrianna GheyRishi Sunak NewsallMost ReadMost RecentM60M60 shuts after two cars crashA section has been closed in TraffordRegent Road blocked after 'four-vehicle crash' with car left wreckedSalfordRegent Road is blocked following the incidentWe moved to Spain to build our dream home - but lost £200k after it turned into a nightmareDream homePhil and Anne Bulman, both 71, were looking forward to spending their retirement in the sunEmergency services scramble at Manchester Airport as easyJet flight due to landManchester AirportA 'technical issue' sparked a major responseBBC presenter left stunned after revealing secret on live TVBBCBBC North West Tonight's weather forecaster Kawser Quamer was left red-faced following the gaffeBBCBBC presenter left stunned after revealing secret on live TVBBC North West Tonight's weather forecaster Kawser Quamer was left red-faced following the gaffeRegent Road blocked after 'four-vehicle crash' with car left wreckedSalfordRegent Road is blocked following the incidentMoment driver runs from police after 91 mph chase ends with a bumpPrestwichThe Peugeot was driven into a street signStrictly's Layton Williams and The Traitors stars dazzle on red carpet as they arrive at glitzy awards night in ManchesterLGBTQ+The Gaydio Pride Awards, that celebrates the efforts of charities, people and organisations that champion the LGBTQ+ community, was held at the iconic Hilton hotel on DeansgatePolice 'increasingly concerned' for missing man last seen wearing medical scrubsBuryAbdulla was last seen in BuryMost ReadMost RecentM60M60 shuts after two cars crashA section has been closed in TraffordRegent Road blocked after 'four-vehicle crash' with car left wreckedSalfordRegent Road is blocked following the incidentI wanted to buy Manchester United but now I've got a $20bn offer to make to Sir Jim RatcliffeManchester United takeoverThomas Zilliacus has exclusively told MEN Sport that he would be willing to sit down with Ratcliffe to discuss his thoughts on generating more funds through a fan inclusion scheme'It's extremely unfair': Restaurant's fury as THIRTY customers don't show for Valentine's Day mealManchester restaurantsThe restaurant issued a plea to diners saying no-shows are ""crippling"" for small independent businessesWe moved to Spain to build our dream home - but lost £200k after it turned into a nightmareDream homePhil and Anne Bulman, both 71, were looking forward to spending their retirement in the sunBBCBBC presenter left stunned after revealing secret on live TVBBC North West Tonight's weather forecaster Kawser Quamer was left red-faced following the gaffeBroken machine delays Jack Grealish injury diagnosis to confuse Man City preparations vs ChelseaManchester City FCManchester City will be without Jack Grealish for the Premier League visit of Chelsea, but don't know how long he will be out injured due to a faulty machine.'Remember that': Pep Guardiola responds to Gary Neville jibe at 'boring' Man CityGary NevilleManchester City manager Pep Guardiola laughed at Gary Neville's suggestion that he had found the Blues too boring to watchManchester City defender's bold title claim proved true in Chelsea winManchester City Women FCManchester City beat Chelsea 1-0 in the Women's Super League to move level on points with the league leadersRegent Road blocked after 'four-vehicle crash' with car left wreckedSalfordRegent Road is blocked following the incident Top StoriesRevealed: The huge masterplan that could soon transform area around Old Trafford stadiumTraffordThe area surrounding Manchester United's Old Trafford could soon be transformedSir Jim Ratcliffe gets major Manchester United boost as 'world-class' plan confirmedManchester United FCLatest Manchester United news and gossip as Trafford Council announces plans to regenerate the local area which could lead to the potential redevelopment of Old TraffordMan City could be missing five players vs ChelseaPep GuardiolaManchester City are waiting on news of three players with Jack Grealish joining Josko Gvardiol on the sidelinesBBC North West Tonight presenter left stunned after revealing secret on live TVBBCBBC North West Tonight's weather forecaster Kawser Quamer was left red-faced following the gaffeThe controversial windows causing a right stink at £800k house in leafy suburbTrafford'The use of uPVC fails to maintain the character of the dwelling in the conservation area'Shark slashes £150 off bestselling vacuum that's 'perfect' for anyone with a dog - but not for longMoney saving and offers""This vacuum is fantastic.

(Photo by Paul Cowley/Advocate staff) Emotions occasionally ran high at a Red Deer town hall meeting as Red Deer-South MLA Jason Stephan defended Premier Danielle Smith’s proposed controversial transgender policies. The town hall at the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame was also billed as an opportunity to discuss the proposed Alberta Pension Plan and many questions in the question and answer session revolved around the ins and outs of that proposal. But Stephan’s presentation on the province’s proposed “parental rights policy” generated the most push-back, with audience members interrupting the MLA several times. Stephan had only just begun walking the crowd through his presentation on the 10 points of the plan, pointing out it would not allow gender reassignment surgeries for minors. “Which doesn’t happen,” shouted out at least two people. Stephan said those kinds of surgeries have happened and asked audience members to remain respectful, a request he would make a number of times. Another part of the policy will require all third-party resource materials or presentations related to gender identity, sexual orientation or human sexuality to be pre-approved by the Ministry of Education. Parents are the principle educators for their children and are equipped to make the best decisions for them and the government wants to make sure they are involved in their education, a comment that drew loud applause as did a number of his other points. “We want to make sure we stay in our lane and focus on the fundamentals in the education of our children,” he said. “How’s that staying in your lane?” someone shouted out. He also defended the policy that says parents must consent for their child under age 15 to change their name or pronouns in schools and that parents be notified of changes if the student is 16 or 17. “We don’t want schools keeping secrets from parents.” In the Alberta Pension Plan segment that kicked off the town hall, a presentation was given by Gord Tulk, a director with Libertas Alberta, which bills itself as a grassroots, non-partisan, registered society dedicated to promoting policy proposals that lead to freer markets, less government and expanded individual freedoms. Tulk said Alberta, with its young population and high wage earners has been subsidizing the pension plan for much of Canada. “The other provinces should have been paying way more than they were,” he said. Meanwhile, the Canada Pension Plan is unwieldy, expensive, is focused too heavily on non-liquid assets such as real estate and infrastructure and lacks transparency. Stephan said an APP would lower premiums for businesses making them more competitive and provide higher benefits for retirees. Stephan also stated his support for moving the “drug consumption site” out of Red Deer, saying it has boosted crime, vandalism and hurt local businesses. Next month, another town hall is scheduled to discuss the hospital expansion, he said. News tipsLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

Ohio’s Health Department has backed off proposed rules that would have restricted gender-affirming care for adults. The new proposal Wednesday, Feb. 7, 2024 comes after gathering public comment on a proposal released last month. Transgender people and their healthcare providers feared the original rules would have left thousands of patients scrambling to find care — and facing health risks in the meantime. The proposed rules are also relaxed for requirements for treatment for minors, some of which was banned by a law adopted last month when the Legislature overrode Gov. Mike DeWine’s earlier veto.

Mike DeWine’s administration on Wednesday backed off its plans to impose rules that advocates feared would have restricted gender-affirming medical treatment for adults in a way no other state has.The rules proposed by two state departments would have required the psychiatrists, endocrinologists and medial ethicists to have roles in creating gender-affirming care plans for clinics and hospitals. And patients under 21 would have been required to receive at least six months of counseling before starting hormone treatment or receiving gender-affirming surgery.The Department of Health and Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services both issued revised proposals Wednesday after gathering public comment. Both said in memos that they were swayed by what they had learned as transgender people and care providers weighed in. The Health Department said it received 3,900 comments. In the new versions, the rules would apply only to the care of minors, not adults. Over the last few years, 21 states have adopted laws banning at least some aspects of gender-affirming care for minors. Some are so new they haven’t taken effect yet, and a ban in Arkansas was struck down in court. But so far, only Florida has restricted care for adults.

(File photo: Vatican Media/­Handout via REUTERS) New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. 07 Feb 2024 09:04PM Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis said he sees ""hypocrisy"" in criticism of his decision to allow priests to bless same-sex couples, possibly his most strongly worded defence of the move. LGBT blessings were authorised last month by a Vatican document called Fiducia Supplicans (Supplicating Trust), but that has met with significant resistance in the Catholic Church, particularly from African bishops. ""Nobody gets scandalised if I give my blessings to a businessman who perhaps exploits people, and this is a very grave sin. But they get scandalised if I give them to a homosexual,"" Francis told Italian Catholic magazine Credere. ""This is hypocrisy,"" he said. Credere released extracts of the interview on Wednesday (Feb 7), a day ahead of publication. Francis, who famously said ""Who am I to judge?"" when asked about homosexuality at the beginning of his papacy, has made it one of his missions to promote a more welcoming and less judgmental Catholic Church. Conservatives say this risks undermining the Church's moral teachings. Francis has defended Fiducia Supplicans on several occasions, but acknowledged the pushback against it, saying for example that blessings do not amount to formal Church approval for same-sex unions. ""When a couple comes forward spontaneously to ask for them, one does not bless the union, but simply the people who together have requested it. Not the union, but the persons,"" he said on Jan 26. The Catholic Church teaches that gay sex is sinful and disordered, and that people with same-sex attractions, which are not considered sinful, should try to be chaste. In another interview published last week, Francis said he hoped critics of LGBT blessings would eventually understand them, but that Africans were a ""special case"" in their opposition to homosexuality. Bishops in Africa have effectively rejected the Fiducia Supplicans. In some African countries, homosexuality is severely punished, with prison sentences or even the death penalty.

Wednesday, 07 Feb 2024 11:45 PM MYT VATICAN CITY, Feb 7 — Pope Francis said he sees “hypocrisy” in criticism of his decision to allow priests to bless same-sex couples, possibly his most strongly worded defence of the move.LGBT blessings were authorised last month by a Vatican document called Fiducia Supplicans (Supplicating Trust), but that has met with significant resistance in the Catholic Church, particularly from African bishops.“Nobody gets scandalised if I give my blessings to a businessman who perhaps exploits people, and this is a very grave sin. But they get scandalised if I give them to a homosexual,” Francis told Italian Catholic magazine Credere.“This is hypocrisy,” he said.AdvertisementCredere released extracts of the interview on Wednesday, a day ahead of publication.Francis also said he “always” welcomes LGBT people and remarried divorcees to the sacrament of confession, according to another passage published by Vatican media.“No one should be denied a blessing. Everyone, everyone, everyone” the pontiff said, repeating a three-word slogan he used in August during a Catholic youth festival in Portugal.AdvertisementFrancis, who famously said “Who am I to judge?” when asked about homosexuality at the beginning of his papacy, has made it one of his missions to make the Catholic Church more welcoming and less judgmental.Conservatives say this risks undermining the Church’s moral teachings.Francis has defended Fiducia Supplicans on several occasions, but acknowledged the pushback against it, saying for example that priests should take into account local sensitivities when giving the blessings.He also stressed that such blessings do not amount to formal Church approval for same-sex unions.“When a couple comes forward spontaneously to ask for them, one does not bless the union, but simply the people who together have requested it. Not the union, but the persons,” Francis said on Jan. 26.The Catholic Church teaches that gay sex is sinful and disordered, and that people with same-sex attractions, which are not considered sinful, should try to be chaste.In another interview published last week by Italy’s La Stampa daily, Francis said he hoped critics of LGBT blessings would eventually understand them, but that Africans were a “special case” in their opposition to homosexuality.Bishops in Africa have effectively rejected the Fiducia Supplicans, saying it cannot be applied without causing scandal. The pope and the head of the Vatican’s doctrinal department, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, have accepted that position.In some African countries, homosexuality is severely punished, with prison sentences or even the death penalty. — Reuters Advertisement You May Also Like Related Articles World / 8 m ago Blinken in 'candid, constructive' talks with China's Wang World / 22 m ago Trump hit with US$354.9m penalty, three-year ban in NY civil fraud case World / 57 m ago Russian emigres gather across Europe to mourn Navalny, denounce Putin Advertisement Just IN 6 m ago Survey: 79pc of Malaysian respondents don’t have financial plan 24 m ago Sarawak minister: NGO to be set up to support sexually abused children 31 m ago DAP man urges Sarawak govt to properly design, build, maintain drainage system to tackle flash floods in Kuching Advertisement News Malaysia Singapore World Money Life Eat/Drink Showbiz Opinion What You Think Sports Tech/Gadgets About ARCHIVES ABOUT US PRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE ADVERTISE Download Subscribe to Newsletter Name Email Subscribe © 2021, Malay Mail, All Rights Reserved. ↑ "

Washington State University received (WSU) $15,000 from the State Department in July 2023 to hold a three-day workshop aimed at training 30 individuals with the goal of them eventually training 2,500 people to become “LGBTQI+ allies” and to develop a “better understanding of diversity and inclusion,” according to a federal spending database. The trainings took place in India between Sept. 25 and Sept. 27, according to the university website.The State Department offered the grant under a program intended to “support the achievement of U.S. foreign policy goals and objectives, advance national interests and enhance national security,” according to a federal spending database. The training sought to “increase the comfort levels of all participants regarding issues faced by members of the LGBTQI+ community,” the university website read. (RELATED: Biden Admin Has Made Exporting ‘LGBT Ideology’ A Key Foreign Policy Priority, Report Says) Individuals participating in the training were instructed on how to properly use “LGBTQI+ language,” taught about the intersection of LGBTQI+ identities and faith, instructed on LGBTQ+ history and put through hours of allyship training, according to the workshop schedule. “LGBTQI+ persons across the globe deserve to live in societies free from targeted violence and discrimination,” a State Department spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “As all G7 leaders reiterated this year in Hiroshima, we work with all segments of society to ensure full, equal, and meaningful participation of LGBTQI+ persons in politics, economics, education, and all other spheres of society.” The State Department’s programs advance LGBTQI+ rights and seek to promote the acceptance of marginalized communities, the spokesperson said. United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken (Photo by Johannes Simon/Getty Images) The State Department has distributed several grants under the Biden administration promoting LGBTQI+ ideology across the world. It disbursed $4.6 million to groups in 55 different countries to fund LGBTQI+ activism as of June 30, according to the Washington Free Beacon. State Department grants have included supporting “queer” Muslim writers in India, providing classes for transgender “makeup entrepreneurs” in Nepal and funding a LGBTQ+ film festival in Portugal that featured pedophilic and incestuous content. Conservative groups including the Heritage Foundation and the Family Research Council have argued that exporting LGBTQI+ ideology has been a priority at the State Department since Biden took office. “Attempting to export contentious current viewpoints held by slim and temporary political majorities does not advance U.S. national interests abroad and might very well induce opposition to them,” the report from the Heritage Foundation reads.

(Photo: Alastair Pike/AFP/Getty Images) President Joe Biden’s State Department paid a public university to train a cohort of “master trainers” in India who will then go on to train more than 2,000 people to become “LGBTQI+ allies,” according to a government spending database. Washington State University received $15,000 from the State Department in July 2023 to hold a three-day workshop aimed at training 30 individuals with the goal of them eventually training 2,500 people to become “LGBTQI+ allies” and to develop a “better understanding of diversity and inclusion,” according to a federal spending database. The trainings took place in India between Sept. 25 and Sept. 27, according to the university website. The State Department offered the grant under a program intended to “support the achievement of U.S. foreign policy goals and objectives, advance national interests and enhance national security,” according to a federal spending database. The training sought to “increase the comfort levels of all participants regarding issues faced by members of the LGBTQI+ community,” the university website read. Individuals participating in the training were instructed on how to properly use “LGBTQI+ language,” taught about the intersection of LGBTQI+ identities and faith, instructed on LGBTQ+ history, and put through hours of allyship training, according to the workshop schedule. The State Department has distributed several grants under the Biden administration promoting LGBTQI+ ideology across the world. The State Department disbursed $4.6 million to groups in 55 different countries to fund LGBTQI+ activism as of June 30, according to The Washington Free Beacon. State Department grants have included supporting “queer” Muslim writers in India, providing classes for transgender “makeup entrepreneurs” in Nepal, and funding a LGBTQ+ film festival in Portugal that featured pedophilic and incestuous content. Conservative groups, including The Heritage Foundation and the Family Research Council, have argued that exporting LGBTQI+ ideology has been a priority at the State Department since Biden took office. “Attempting to export contentious current viewpoints held by slim and temporary political majorities does not advance U.S. national interests abroad and might very well induce opposition to them,” the report from The Heritage Foundation reads.

According to a government spending database, the grant will also promote a “better understanding of diversity and inclusion.” The objective of the grant, along with similar programs, was to “support the achievement of U.S. foreign policy goals and objectives, advance national interests, and enhance national security by informing and influencing foreign publics and by expanding and strengthening the relationship between the people and government of the United States and citizens of the rest of the world.” The grant was awarded on July 1, 2023, and runs through June 30, 2024. American Faith previously reported that the State Department provided funding for an India-based Queer Muslim group. According to a description of the grant, “The Queer Muslim Project will provide a platform to a group of young LGBTQIA writers from underrepresented communities in South Asia to showcase their work at a leading Mumbai literature festival alongside writers from the Iowa Writing Program.” The State Department is also funding a dancing program to “uplift transgender and gender diverse” people in Peru. “Ballroom Saves Lives: Resiliency and Wellness in Peru Ballroom” is a winner of the Citizen Diplomacy Action Fund (CDAF), a competition that focuses on “strengthening democratic institutions and fighting disinformation,” “protecting the environment,” “human rights, refugees, and migrants,” “building community through arts, sports, language, and technology,” and “fostering alumni network development.” Previous articleMore Than One Million Migrants Encountered Since OctoberNext articleHigh-Stakes Case: Supreme Court Considers Trump’s Candidacy Eligibility LATEST VIDEO Politics Faith Health Education Opinion Business About Contributors Terms of Use|Privacy PolicyThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2023 American Faith News Media.

Shame.”Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the Labour leader said: “This is nothing to do with me. This is Brianna’s father. They’ve had their child murdered and he has put his words out about what the Prime Minister said and it’s not good enough for the Prime Minister’s team to go out today and effectively say to Brianna’s father ‘you didn’t understand what Rishi was saying’.“He did understand.

The Prime Minister was making a point about Labour’s very numerous flip-flops.”Asked about Mr Spooner’s request for an apology, Mr Philp said he was “very sad” to hear his comments, but suggested people “should actually listen” to the exchange in the House of Commons.Matt Mathers8 February 2024 14:16Newer1 / 5OlderMore aboutPrime Minister's QuestionsRishi SunakBrianna GheySir Keir Starmertrans communityJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/1Brianna Ghey’s mother breaks silence over Rishi Sunak trans rowBrianna Ghey’s mother breaks silence over Rishi Sunak trans rowPrime Minister Rishi Sunak made the jibe after the Commons had heard the mother of murdered transgender teenager Brianna Ghey was watching from the gallery (House of Commons/UK Parliament/PA)PA Wire✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In 2008, she came out to her crew as transgender.While some in the department grumbled, Moore said both her chief and union president were fully supportive, and two years after she retired in 2016, she was inducted into the city's hall of fame.That’s why it pains her to know Ohio lawmakers – for whom, she said, she would have laid down her life as a firefighter – last month overrode Gov. Mike DeWine’s veto of HB 68, a bill banning gender-affirming care for young people and preventing transgender girls and women from competing in female high school and college sports. And they’re still mulling a slate of bills that would restrict transgender rights and visibility.“It’s frightening,” Moore said. “It feels like I’ve been betrayed. They’ve identified a small minority of people they can stereotype and scapegoat. I’m not a historian, but I paid attention in history class, and it’s not hard to recognize what’s happening here.”As Republican lawmakers nationwide continue to introduce bills targeting the LGBTQ+ community – and specifically transgender people – at rates on par with last year’s record numbers, Moore and community advocates fear a rising tide of hostile rhetoric is designed to ultimately erase them from public life.This week, Florida officials revoked transgender residents’ ability to update gender markers on driver’s licenses and ID cards; Utah passed a bill banning transgender people from bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity; and Texas’ attorney general pressed a clinic in Georgia for medical records of transgender young people who used telehealth to obtain gender-affirming care there.'It has progressively gotten worse'The Human Rights Campaign, among the country’s largest LGBTQ+ civil rights groups, said 130 bills targeting transgender rights had been filed nationwide in 2024, compared with roughly 225 last year. Overall, the group said, 325 anti-LGBTQ+ bills had been proposed in 2024 as of Jan. 25, compared with 503 in all of 2023.“For years, transgender people have warned of radical anti-LGBTQ+ forces’ true aim: to abuse governmental power to take away our freedoms and drive trans people out of public society,” said Kelley Robinson, the organization’s president, in a statement decrying what she called a “sinister agenda.""“They want to humiliate, harass and use policy to eliminate transgender people from public life,” she said.Last week, Michigan news outlet Mlive.com reported Republicans in the Michigan and Ohio legislatures described banning access to gender-affirming care for adults as well as young people as the “endgame” in a conversation on the social media platform X.Siobhan Boyd-Nelson, co-interim executive director of Equality Ohio, said the group was “profoundly disappointed” in Ohio “lawmakers’ unwillingness to listen to medical professionals, young people and their families. ... There’s absolutely no reason for government overreach into the personal medical decisions of Ohioans.”“It has progressively gotten worse, and we know that Ohio is not alone,” Boyd-Nelson said. “We’re seeing it happen across the country, and we think people should be very concerned about what appears to be an obsession with marginalizing and harming an already marginalized community.”Anti-equality bills outnumber those in supportWhen Moore grew up in the 1970s, she didn’t know the term ""transgender""; not until she saw transgender actress and activist Christine Jorgensen on a talk show did she realize she wasn’t the only person who felt as she did.“I took an oath as a civil servant, and I took it seriously,” Moore said. “That didn’t end when I retired. But it looks like they’ve (Republican lawmakers) taken an oath to a political party.”According to health policy research organization KFF, 23 states have enacted laws or policies limiting youth access to gender affirming care as of Jan. 31, while 21 states have laws or policies imposing professional or legal penalties on health care practitioners who provide minors with such care.Gender-affirming care includes using hormones to delay puberty and support physical development aligning with a youth's identity, and has been endorsed by major health groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Proponents of laws prohibiting such care say the bans are intended to protect youths from making life-altering decisions at a young age.""Families should never fear losing custody of their children for not consenting to superstitious gender ideology,"" Ohio state Rep. Gary Click, sponsor of HB 68, in a news release.In his veto of that bill, Gov. DeWine said that should the bill become law, ""Ohio would be saying that the state, that the government knows better what is medically best for a child than the two people who love that child the most: their parents.""According to the Human Rights Campaign’s 2023 State Equality Index, more than 253 pro-equality bills were introduced nationwide last year; 50 of them were signed into law.In contrast, the campaign tallied 571 anti-equality bills in 2023, with 77 of them becoming law.The campaign gave 20 states and Washington its highest rating (“working toward innovative equality”), and another five were characterized as “solidifying equality,” the index’s next highest ranking.But 23 other states, most of them in the South, were deemed “high priority to achieve basic equality,” the list’s lowest rating.“States are trying to rewrite laws to exclude LGBTQ+ people from sex-based protections, and they are continuing to try to erase LGBTQ+ people from history, from the classroom, from artistic performance, and from sport,” the report reads.'Other people are defining us'Florida is among the states in the campaign’s lowest rated category. In addition to revoking the ability of transgender people to change the listed gender on their driver’s licenses, the state has passed laws restricting transgender people from using bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity in public schools and places, transgender youth participation in sports, gender-affirming care for transgender young people and inclusion of LGBTQ+ topics in schools.“The DeSantis administration’s obsession with scapegoating transgender Floridians has escalated into an outrageous attack that further erodes freedom and liberty in our state,” said Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, in a statement. “These reckless and hateful policies are intended to make the transgender community feel unsafe and unwelcome in Florida and to bully them out of public life entirely.” Alaina Kupec, president of transgender advocacy group Gender Research Advisory Council + Education, or GRACE, said transgender people provide a ""politically opportunistic"" group for candidates to prey on. She started the organization out of exasperation over the rhetoric influencing public perceptions of the trans community.“Nobody was really changing the narrative being put out by hate groups telling outright lies about transgender people and our lives and the care that we get,” Kupec said. “I thought, maybe I should be challenging these five-alarm fires we’re seeing across the country. … Other people are defining us instead of us defining ourselves.”Through GRACE, Kupec helps trans advocacy groups around the country get their message out while providing them with research and data on issues like gender-affirming care.“We have a world where the left is shouting at the right and the right is shouting at the left,” she said. “We want to find that movable middle and appeal to their values and not have them see us as the enemy or the woke left. People have tried to portray these issues as partisan, and they’re not.”Climate prompts fears for personal safetyKupec and others say some politicians have seized on transgender issues as a means of distraction, trying to make up for lost votes over abortion rights.“This is purely political theater designed to capture attention,” she said, noting a federal judge last year struck down a 2021 Arkansas law banning gender-affirming care for trans youth, calling it unconstitutional and motivated by ideology. “At the end of the day, the courts are going to knock these things down, because the medical evidence is overwhelming.”Boyd-Nelson, of Equality Ohio, said that while some politicians might fixate on these issues to score points with their constituencies, she wonders at what cost.“Lives are at stake, and that’s what’s so disgusting about this.”Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software© 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC."

Follow: LGBTQ issues See all topics The 2022 US Transgender Survey offers insights into the lives and experiences of transgender Americans. Demetrius Freeman/Reuters Story highlights Majority of those who transitioned said they were satisfied with life Some reported moving states because of laws targeting transgender people Still, jobless rate among respondents was nearly 5 times national average Nearly a quarter said they avoided seeing a doctor out of fear of mistreatment CNN — Results from the largest survey of transgender people in the United States were released Wednesday, revealing key insights into their lives and experiences at a time when trans rights have increasingly come under attack. The 2022 US Transgender Survey Early Insights report, conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, polled an “unprecedented” 92,329 binary and nonbinary transgender people ages 16 and older living in the US, its territories or military bases, according to the report. Respondents were surveyed on issues including their family life, health care, employment, education, housing and public accommodation. While many transgender people surveyed who have transitioned said they were satisfied with their lives, the report also noted transgender people continue to face disparities and discrimination across the country. Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, executive director of NCTE, said there should be state and federal laws to ensure that everyone – including transgender people – is treated fairly. “So often, transgender people are talked about, like we’re a political football, or mysterious,” he said. “Now, we finally have concrete facts, we actually have some data to show what being transgender in America is really like and that is essential because these attacks against our community are coming from misinformation and a lack of understanding of who we really are.” Life after transitioning The survey found the majority of people who transitioned genders said they were satisfied with their lives. Ninety-four percent of respondents who lived at least some of the time in a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth reported being “a lot more satisfied” or “a little more satisfied” with their life, with 79% expressing the highest level of satisfaction,﻿ according to the report. Only three percent of people surveyed indicated they were “a little less satisfied” (1%) or “a lot less satisfied” (2%), the report found. What’s more, “nearly all” respondents who said they were receiving hormone treatment at the time of the survey – 98% – said receiving hormones for their gender identity/transition increased satisfaction with their life. Eighty-four percent of respondents said they were “a lot more satisfied” while receiving hormone treatment and 14% of respondents said they were “a little more satisfied.” Less than 1% of people surveyed said receiving the hormones made them less satisfied with their lives. Discrimination and mistreatment The report’s findings come as multiple states have passed laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care. Forty percent of people surveyed said they considered moving because they experienced discrimination or unequal treatment where they were living, and 10% said they had already moved because of discrimination. Maya Stanton, 12, and her mother Lisa are photographed at their Colorado home on January 26, 2024. Laura Oliverio/CNN Related article Anguish lingers as transgender kids’ families seek medical care outside Texas — and fight a state ban Respondents also reported moving from states like Florida, Virginia, Texas, and North Carolina because of laws targeting transgender people for unequal treatment. More than a third (39%) of respondents said they were harassed online because of their gender expression or identity in the previous 12 months, and 30% reported being verbally harassed during the same time frame. The report also revealed findings that suggest the ongoing culture war over transgender rights has impacted students. Nearly 60% of respondents ages 16 to 17 who are out or perceived as transgender in grades K-12 said they experienced mistreatment or a negative experience, including“verbal harassment, physical attacks, online bullying, being denied the ability to dress according to their gender identity/expression, teachers or staff refusing to use chosen name or pronouns, or being denied the use of restrooms or locker rooms matching their gender identity.” A majority of respondents of all ages, 62%, also said they were “very uncomfortable” or “somewhat uncomfortable” asking police for help when needed because of their gender expression or identity. “This data is crucial to really show an accurate picture of transgender people’s experiences,” Heng-Lehtinen said. “There are rising attacks against transgender people these days, both in terms of hostile policy, meaning anti-transgender bills moving through state legislatures, and in terms of physical attacks - people actually being hurt and even killed because they happen to be transgender.” Health and safety When asked about their health care experiences, nearly half of respondents, 48%, who had seen a provider in the past 12 months said they had at least one negative experience because they were transgender, according to the report. Texas state Attorney General Ken Paxton has made requests in at least two states for the private medical records of transgender youth. Eric Gay/AP/FILE Related article Texas attorney general targets Georgia clinic in another attempt to obtain private medical records of transgender youth Some of those experiences reported included, “being refused health care, being misgendered, having a provider use harsh or abusive language when treating them, or having a provider be physically rough or abusive when treating them.” Nearly a quarter of respondents said they avoided seeing a doctor in the previous year when they needed to out of fear of mistreatment, while 28% said they did not go to the doctor during that timeframe because of cost. The report also found that the unemployment rate among respondents was nearly five times the national average –18%. The 2022 US Trans Survey is a follow up to the 2015 US Trans Survey, which included more than 27,700 respondents across the US, its territories and its military bases. The 2022 survey was conducted online in Spanish and English by the NCTE in conjunction with the Black Trans Advocacy Coalition, National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance, and TransLatin@ Coalition. Participants were surveyed from October 19 through December 5, 2022, and the majority of respondents – 84,170 – were ages 18 and older.

Demetrius Freeman/Reuters Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save (CNN) — Results from the largest survey of transgender people in the United States were released Wednesday, revealing key insights into their lives and experiences at a time when trans rights have increasingly come under attack.The 2022 US Transgender Survey Early Insights report, conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, polled an “unprecedented” 92,329 binary and nonbinary transgender people ages 16 and older living in the US, its territories or military bases, according to the report.Respondents were surveyed on issues including their family life, health care, employment, education, housing and public accommodation. While many transgender people surveyed who have transitioned said they were satisfied with their lives, the report also noted transgender people continue to face disparities and discrimination across the country.Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, executive director of NCTE, said there should be state and federal laws to ensure that everyone – including transgender people – is treated fairly.“No one should ever face discrimination in employment, housing, health care, education, and other areas of life just because of who they are,” Heng-Lehtinen said in a statement. “Transgender people are here to stay, and we are proud of who we are.”Life after transitioningThe survey found the majority of people who transitioned genders said they were satisfied with their lives.Ninety-four percent of respondents who lived at least some of the time in a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth reported being “a lot more satisfied” or “a little more satisfied” with their life, with 79% expressing the highest level of satisfaction, according to the report.Only three percent of people surveyed indicated they were “a little less satisfied” (1%) or “a lot less satisfied” (2%), the report found.What’s more, “nearly all” respondents who said they were receiving hormone treatment at the time of the survey – 98% – said receiving hormones for their gender identity/transition increased satisfaction with their life.Eighty-four percent of respondents said they were “a lot more satisfied” while receiving hormone treatment and 14% of respondents said they were “a little more satisfied.” Less than 1% of people surveyed said receiving the hormones made them less satisfied with their lives.Discrimination and mistreatmentThe report’s findings come as multiple states have passed laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care. Forty percent of people surveyed said they considered moving because they experienced discrimination or unequal treatment where they were living, and 10% said they had already moved because of discrimination.Respondents also reported moving from states like Florida, Virginia, Texas, and North Carolina because of laws targeting transgender people for unequal treatment.More than a third (39%) of respondents said they were harassed online because of their gender expression or identity in the previous 12 months, and 30% reported being verbally harassed during the same time frame.The report also revealed findings that suggest the ongoing culture war over transgender rights has impacted students.Nearly 60% of respondents ages 16 to 17 who are out or perceived as transgender in grades K-12 said they experienced mistreatment or a negative experience, including“verbal harassment, physical attacks, online bullying, being denied the ability to dress according to their gender identity/expression, teachers or staff refusing to use chosen name or pronouns, or being denied the use of restrooms or locker rooms matching their gender identity.”A majority of respondents of all ages, 62%, also said they were “very uncomfortable” or “somewhat uncomfortable” asking police for help when needed because of their gender expression or identity.Health and safetyWhen asked about their health care experiences, nearly half of respondents, 48%, who had seen a provider in the past 12 months said they had at least one negative experience because they were transgender, according to the report.Some of those experiences reported included, “being refused health care, being misgendered, having a provider use harsh or abusive language when treating them, or having a provider be physically rough or abusive when treating them.”Nearly a quarter of respondents said they avoided seeing a doctor in the previous year when they needed to out of fear of mistreatment, while 28% said they did not go to the doctor during that timeframe because of cost.The report also found that the unemployment rate among respondents was nearly five times the national average –18%.The 2022 US Trans Survey is a follow up to the 2015 US Trans Survey, which included more than 27,700 respondents across the US, its territories and its military bases. The 2022 survey was conducted online in Spanish and English by the NCTE in conjunction with the Black Trans Advocacy Coalition, National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance, and TransLatin@ Coalition.Participants were surveyed from October 19 through December 5, 2022, and the majority of respondents – 84,170 – were ages 18 and older.CNN’s Scottie Andrew contributed to this report.The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

During Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak ridiculed Sir Keir Starmer for U-turning on ""defining a woman"".No 10 said it was ""legitimate"" to question the Labour leader's position.But Brianna's father, who is among those calling for an apology, said the PM's comment was ""degrading"".Teach mindfulness in schools, says Brianna's mumMP backs Brianna Ghey mum's social media callHer father, Peter Spooner, told Sky News: ""As the prime minister for our country to come out with degrading comments like he did, regardless of them being in relation to discussions in Parliament, they are absolutely dehumanising.""Identities of people should not be used in that manner, and I personally feel shocked by his comments and feel he should apologise for his remarks.""Brianna's family are being invited to a meeting about online safety with the prime minister and Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan, the BBC has been told.At PMQs, Mr Sunak listed what he described as a number of Labour U-turns, accusing Sir Keir of changing his position on ""defining a woman"". ""Although in fairness, that was only 99% of a U-turn,"" he added. Sir Keir hit back, saying: ""Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna's mother is in this chamber. Shame.""Parading as a man of integrity when he's got absolutely no responsibility.""Brianna's mother Esther was not in the public gallery for the exchange but entered shortly afterwards.Later, Mr Sunak ignored a call from Labour MP Liz Twist to ""apologise to Brianna Ghey's mother"".But at the end of the session the prime minister said Ms Ghey represented ""the very best of humanity"" for the ""compassion"" she showed after her 16-year-old daughter was murdered by two teenagers who had a fascination with violence.He added that the murder ""was an unspeakable and shocking tragedy"".A spokeswoman for Sir Keir said: ""We don't think the country wants or deserves a prime minister who is happy to use minorities as a punch bag.""The comments were deeply offensive to trans people. He should reflect on his response there and apologise.""Chancellor questioned on whether PM made trans joke at PMQsMinister for Women and Equalities Kemi Badenoch said it was ""shameful"" of Sir Keir ""to link his own inability to be clear on the matter of sex and gender"" to Ms Ghey's grief. ""Every murder is a tragedy. None should be trivialised by political point-scoring,"" the Tory MP wrote on X. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt denied Mr Sunak had made a minority group ""a punchline for a joke"" and declined to say whether he thought the PM should apologise. ""The prime minister could not have been clearer about the enormous respect that he has for Brianna Ghey's mother,"" he told the BBC. ""What he was saying is that on the really important issues of the day Labour and Sir Keir Starmer simply cannot make up [their] mind.""However, some Conservative MPs criticised the prime minister's comments. Dehenna Davison said it was ""disappointing to hear jokes being made at the trans community's expense"". ""As politicians, it's our job to take the heat out of such debates and focus on finding sensible ways forward, whilst ensuring those involved are treated with respect,"" the MP for Bishop Auckland wrote on X. Jamie Wallis, who was the first MP to say publicly that he had gender dysphoria and is in the process of transitioning, said: ""I know from from my own interactions with the prime minister that today's display of insensitivity must have been inadvertent. ""Today has been a tough day for me, but all I can think about right now is Brianna's mother. Let us all think of her as we choose how to progress with this debate.""Another Tory MP, Elliot Colburn, said what happened during PMQs was ""disappointing"". ""I'd rather every politician stopped using trans issues as an electoral issue,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""[Trans people] have never asked to be part of this very toxic conversation, so we need to stop it.""Family handoutBrianna Ghey's mother Esther is calling for mindfulness to be part of the school curriculum to teach children to be more empatheticMs Ghey was in the Houses of Parliament to attend a debate on mindfulness in schools, organised by her local MP Charlotte Nichols.She also met Sir Keir after Prime Minister's Questions.

He was scheduled to meet her afterwards.“This week, the unwavering bravery of Brianna Ghey’s mother, Esther, has touched us all. As a father I can’t even imagine the pain that she’s going through. And I’m glad that she’s with us in the gallery here today,” Starmer said.Later, responding to a question from Starmer on the government’s failure to cut hospital waiting lists, Sunak said: “It’s a bit rich to hear about promises from someone who’s broken every single promise he was elected on.“I think I counted almost 30 in the last year: pensions, planning, peerages, public sector pay, tuition fees, childcare, second referendums, defining a woman – although in fairness that was only 99% of a U-turn. The list goes on but the theme is the same. It’s empty words, broken promises and absolutely no plan.”Starmer has previously said “99.9%” of women do not have penises, though Downing Street was unable to say whether this was what Sunak had been referring to.An evidently angry Starmer replied: “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in the chamber. Shame. Parading as a man of integrity. When he’s got absolutely no responsibility.”Sunak ignored this in his next reply. When asked later in the session by Labour’s Liz Twist to apologise to Brianna’s mother, he ignored the question, despite shouts of “apologise” from the opposition benches.At the end of PMQs, Sunak praised Esther Ghey, saying she represented “the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity, and she deserves all our admiration and praise”. He did not apologise, however.It is understood that while Sunak made the comments after being told Ghey was watching, she actually arrived in chamber slightly late and so missed the initial exchange.Downing Street afterward said the prime minister stood by what he said in the chamber. Sunak’s press secretary said: “It is legitimate in the house to be able point out the changes in position the leader of the opposition has made.”Asked if the prime minister thought it was acceptable to use trans people as the punchline to a joke, the press secretary said: “I don’t accept that characterisation.”A Labour spokesperson said: “We don’t think that the country wants or deserves a prime minister that is happy to use minorities as a punch bag. The comments were really deeply offensive to trans people, and he should reflect on his response there and apologise.”Sunak and his ministers routinely attack Labour’s position on transgender rights. Last year the party changed its policy on a self-identification system that would let people officially change their gender without a medical diagnosis.Last Friday, Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe, both 16, were sentenced for murdering 16-year-old Brianna after luring her to a park in Cheshire in February 2023. Ratcliffe was found to have been partly motivated by hostility to Brianna’s transgender identity.Since the sentencing, when the killers were identified for the first time, Esther Ghey has called for “empathy and compassion” towards their families, as “they too have lost a child” and “must live the rest of their lives knowing what their child has done”.Jenkinson’s family thanked Brianna’s mother for her “incredible selflessness and empathy towards our family”.Explore more on these topicsPMQsTransgenderKeir StarmerRishi SunakLabourHouse of CommonsnewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyRishi Sunak defends Rwanda plan during GB News Q&A session4d agoGreen party incorrectly sacked spokesperson in part over trans rights views, court rules9 Feb 2024‘I want to make things better’: Esther Ghey on her hopes for online reform4d agoSunak refuses to apologise to Brianna Ghey’s father over PMQs trans jibe8 Feb 2024We’ve given up the fight, say top Tories as byelection defeats loom6d agoBrianna Ghey’s mother warns tech bosses more children will die without action4d agoBrianna Ghey’s mother tells vigil daughter was ‘amazing, unique and joyful’5d agoMinister defends Sunak’s transgender jibe amid calls for apology8 Feb 2024Rishi Sunak ‘up for the fight’ as Tories continue to lag in the polls7d agoBrianna Ghey’s father demands apology from Sunak over transgender remark7 Feb 2024Most viewedMost viewedUKWorldClimate crisisUkraineFootballNewslettersBusinessEnvironmentUK politicsEducationSocietyScienceTechGlobal developmentObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Read our privacy noticeRishi Sunak provoked outrage by joking about the “definition of a woman” in the Commons as the mother of murdered trans teenager Brianna Ghey visited parliament.The prime minister clashed with Sir Keir Starmer over the continuing trans debate at PMQs as Esther Ghey was due to appear in the public gallery just four days after her 16-year-old daughter’s killers were jailed for life. Mr Sunak accused the opposition leader of being incapable of “defining a woman” and that it was one of a number of issues on which he had performed a U-turn.But his jibe prompted howls of protest from MPs, who accused him of a “cruel” joke, “shameful” behaviour and using minorities as a punchline. After the heated clashes, Labour called on Mr Sunak to apologise but Downing Street defended the prime minister’s conduct, describing it as “legitimate”.RecommendedCrass, tactless – could Rishi Sunak’s trans blunder lose him the election?The prime minister has a politics problem – he isn’t very good at itThink Sunak can magic a Major-style win? Dream on...Outraged by the remarks, Brianna’s father Peter Spooner demanded an apology, saying he was “disgusted” with Mr Sunak, before branding the comments “degrading” and “absolutely dehumanising”.Brianna Ghey’s mother Esther Ghey was in parliament on Wednesday (PA)The row deepened further when the business secretary Kemi Badenoch accused Labour of weaponising the issue for their political ends. The incident is bound to be used by Mr Sunak’s critics as further evidence that he is “tin-eared” – an allegation rejected by his allies.The clash came as Mr Sunak accused the Labour leader of breaking pledges he was elected on, adding that Sir Keir had U-turned on “defining a woman, although, in fairness, that was only 99 per cent of a U-turn”.The tone-deaf remarks were in reference to Sir Keir’s previous comments that “99.9 per cent of women do not have penises”.An angry Sir Keir immediately admonished the Tory leader. He said: “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in this chamber. Shame.”He accused the PM of “parading as a man of integrity when he has got absolutely no responsibility”, while shouts of “shame” rang out from the backbenches.He added: “I think the role of the prime minister is to make sure that every single citizen in this country feels safe and respected, and it’s a shame the prime minister doesn’t share that.”It later emerged that Brianna’s mother had not been in the Commons chamber when Sir Keir and Mr Sunak crossed swords, although both men were under the impression she was.Rishi Sunak was criticised during PMQs (PA)She arrived soon afterwards, however. Asked about the remarks by Sky News later in the evening, Mr Spooner said: “As the prime minister for our country, to come out with degrading comments like he did, regardless of them being in relation to discussions in parliament, they are absolutely dehumanising.“Identities of people should not be used in that manner, and I personally feel shocked by his comments and feel he should apologise for his remarks.”The blunder is the latest in a series of political missteps from the PM. He was criticised for betting Piers Morgan £1,000 that deportation flights to Rwanda would take off before the general election, and for an embarrassing moment when he laughed as a mother pleaded with him to cut NHS waiting lists for her daughter. Mr Sunak did not apologise for his jibe, although at the end of PMQs, he did address Ms Ghey to praise her “compassion and empathy”, reiterating that he thought she “demonstrated the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity”. Keir Starmer admonished the Tory leader for the remarks, saying: ‘Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in this chamber. Shame’ (UK Parliament/YouTube)Tory MP Jamie Wallis, the UK’s first transgender MP, said Mr Sunak had been insensitive: “I know from my own interactions with the prime minister that today’s display of insensitivity must have been inadvertent. Today has been a tough day for me but all I can think about right now is Brianna’s mother. Let us all think of her as we choose how to progress with this debate.”One former Conservative minister said they were appalled.Tory backbencher Dehenna Davison said it was “disappointing to hear jokes being made at the trans community’s expense. Our words ... resonate right across our society, and we all need to remember that.” Labour Party chair Anneliese Dodds said it was not the first time the PM had “used LGBT+ people as a punchline to a cruel joke”. But she described his latest jibe as a “shameful new low”.Labour’s Jess Phillips called the prime minister “an absolute disgrace”.On social media site X, formerly Twitter, she wrote: “Rishi Sunak is an absolute disgrace. Deplorable man with no heart, no sense, no clue. The sooner we are rid the better.”She added: “How dare he be so gross in the face of the family of a murdered child. He is the lowest of the low.”Labour’s Ben Bradshaw, one of the first openly gay MPs elected to parliament, called Mr Sunak a “disgusting man” and accused him of “making transphobic slurs”.No 10 defended Mr Sunak’s remarks as “legitimate” and did not rule out that he would use them again.The prime minister’s press secretary said it was “legitimate” for Mr Sunak to “point out the number of U-turns the leader of the opposition has made,” and said they did not accept the prime minister had used trans people as a punchline.Sir Keir, who met Brianna’s mother at her request, pledged his party would “work with campaigners and parents like Esther to ensure our children and young people have the mental health support they need”.But Ms Badenoch hit back, saying: “Every murder is a tragedy. None should be trivialised by political point-scoring. As a mother, I can imagine the trauma that Esther Ghey has endured.“It was shameful of Starmer to link his own inability to be clear on the matter of sex and gender directly to her grief. “As Minister for Women and Equalities, I’ve done all I can to ensure we have taken the heat out of the debate on LGBT issues while being clear about our beliefs and principles.“Keir Starmer’s behaviour today shows Labour are happy to weaponise this issue when it suits them.”In his Tory conference speech last year, Mr Sunak told Conservative delegates in Manchester: “We shouldn't get bullied into believing that people can be any sex they want to be. They can’t – a man is a man and a woman is a woman.”LGBT+ charity Stonewall called Mr Sunak’s words “cheap, callous and crass”.More aboutPMQspoliticsRishi SunakPrime MinisterJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/4Uproar over Sunak’s trans jibe as Brianna Ghey’s mother visits MPsUproar over Sunak’s trans jibe as Brianna Ghey’s mother visits MPsBrianna Ghey’s mother Esther Ghey was in parliament on Wednesday PA WireUproar over Sunak’s trans jibe as Brianna Ghey’s mother visits MPsRishi Sunak was criticised during PMQsPA WireUproar over Sunak’s trans jibe as Brianna Ghey’s mother visits MPsKeir Starmer admonished the Tory leader for the remarks, saying: ‘Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in this chamber.

The shocking exchange came just moments after the Labour leader welcomed Esther Ghey, who was due to appear from the public gallery at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Starmer praised her ""unwavering bravery"" just days after two teenagers were jailed for the murder of 16-year-old Brianna last year. ""As a father, I can't even imagine the pain that she is going through and I am glad that she is with us in the gallery here today,"" he added. But as Mr Sunak launched into his attack lines at PMQs, he accused Mr Starmer of failing to stand by his commitments and U-turning on ""defining a woman"". Mr Starmer replied: ""Of all the weeks to say that when Brianna's mother is in this chamber - shame. Parading as a man of integrity when he's got absolutely no responsibility."" Other MPs also shouted ""shame"" while one could be heard saying: ""Disgusting"". No10 refuses six times to apologise for Rishi Sunak's trans joke as Brianna Ghey's mum visits Commons Keir Starmer met with Brianna Ghey's mother Esther in Parliament on Wednesday ( Image: Getty Images) Labour MP Liz Twist later asked the PM whether he ""could consider apologising"" to Brianna's mother for his ""insensitive comment"" - but Mr Sunak swerved the question. No10 also refused to apologise on six ocassions when later asked by reporters. His press secretary insisted it was ""legitimate"" to point out Mr Starmer's ""U-turns"". She said: “I think if you look back at what the PM was saying, there was a long list of U-turns the leader of the opposition had been making. I don’t think those u-turns are a joke. I think it was quite serious changes in public policy. I think it’s totally legitimate to point those out.” If you can't see the poll, click here Instead as he concluded PMQs, Mr Sunak said: ""If I could just say also to Brianna Ghey's mother who is here, as I said earlier this week, what happened was an unspeakable and shocking tragedy. As I said earlier this week, in the face of that, for her mother to demonstrate the compassion and empathy that she did last weekend, I thought demonstrated the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity. She deserves all our admiration and praise for that."" Carol Vorderman demands Rishi Sunak resign immediately over 'sick' trans joke at PMQs Brianna Ghey and mother Esther Mr Starmer later met with Esther in his parliamentary office. A spokesman for the Labour leader said: ""We don’t think the country wants or deserves a Prime Minister who is happy to use minorities as a punch bag. His comments were deeply offensive to trans people and he should reflect on his response and apologise.” The Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper MP added: ""Every day, Sunak just sinks lower and lower. His behaviour is appalling and deeply disturbing, but it's hard to be shocked by this lack of empathy from a man who bets on asylum seekers' lives. People are not a punchline - and it's long overdue that the Prime Minister learns that. The British public, and Brianna's mother, deserve so much more than this."" Posting on social media, Labour MP Kate Osborne also said: ""For the Prime Minister to make a what is a woman quip at #PMQs when Brianna's mum Esther Ghey is in the Gallery is an absolute disgrace."" She said Mr Starmer was ""absolutely right to call him out and shout shame"". A second Labour MP Nadia Whittome added: ""Absolutely sickening for Rishi Sunak to make a transphobic joke at PMQs while Brianna Ghey’s mother is watching in the chamber. That’s all trans people are to him: an opportunity for cheap point-scoring. There are no words. What a disgrace."" Former Countdown host and LBC presenter Carol Vorderman also called on Mr Sunak to resign over the comments. She told The Mirror: ""Rishi Sunak should immediately resign for his sick joke mocking trans people when he knew that Brianna Ghey’s mother was in the Houses of Parliament. The fact that the Tory benches sat laughing like a pack of hyenas tells you everything you need to know about this party.” Stonewall's spokesperson said: ""For the Prime Minister to use trans people as a punchline, in front of the grieving mother of a murdered trans child, was cheap, callous and crass. The disrespect and dehumanisation of trans people that we see played out daily in the media and in our political discourse has real life consequences and it has to stop. We call on the Prime Minister to apologise unreservedly for his comments, and for him to reflect on how careless words from those in power can and do result in harm.""

Sir Keir Starmer addressed the statement in the Commons today, when Sunak joked that Starmer had changed his position on ‘defining a woman’. It came following Sir Keir’s tribute to murdered transgender teenager Brianna Ghey as her mum Esther was in parliament and will meet with him later today. Sir Keir had said Brianna’s murder had ‘touched us all’ prior to Sunak’s jab. The Prime Minister said shortly after Sir Keir’s tribute: ‘We are bringing the waiting lists down for the longest waiters and making progress, but it is a bit rich to hear about promises from someone who has broken every single promise he was elected on. ‘I think I have counted almost 30 in the last year. Pensions, planning, peerages, public sector pay, tuition fees, childcare, second referendums, defining a woman, although in fairness that was only 99% of a U-turn.’ Sunak’s statement was met with chants of ‘shame’ from the Labour side of the Commons as Tory MPs behind Sunak were seen laughing. MPs laughed as Sunak made the remark (Picture: AFP) Esther Ghey, mum of murdered Brianna Ghey, was in parliament when the remarks were made (Picture: PA) The ‘joke’ was met with chants of ‘shame’ (Picture: Family)Sir Keir stood up, hands shaking, and replied: ‘Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in this chamber. Shame. Parading as a man of integrity when he’s got absolutely no responsibility. ‘I think the role of the Prime Minister is to ensure that every single citizen in this country feels safe and respected, it’s a shame that the Prime Minister doesn’t share that.’ Sunak may have been referring to Sir Keir’s statement in the Sunday Times, when the Labour leader said: ‘I think there is a fear that somehow there could be the rolling back of some of the things that have been won. ‘There are still many battles that need to go ahead for women and I don’t think we should roll anything back.’ Sir Keir added that 99.9% of women ‘of course haven’t got a penis’ when asked about whether a person with a penis can be a woman. Ms Ghey met with Sir Keir a few hours after the remarks were made during PMQs, and posted on X: ‘I am utterly in awe of her strength and bravery in the face of such unimaginable grief, as she campaigns to make sure no parent has to go through what she did. ‘Labour will work with campaigners and parents like Esther to ensure our children and young people have the mental health support they need. It’s what Brianna and her family deserve.’ Sir Keir met with Brianna’s mum in parliament today after the debacle (Picture: Getty) Sir Keir slammed the Prime Minister’s comment (Picture: PA) Brianna was just 16 when she was murdered (Picture: PA)Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Downing Street said: ‘If you look back on what the Prime Minister was saying, there was a long list of U-turns that the leader of the opposition had been making. ‘I don’t think those U-turns are a joke, it is quite serious changes in public policy. I think it is totally legitimate for the Prime Minister to point those out.’ It comes as earlier, MP Liz Twist of Blaydon was ignored by Sunak after asking him: ‘May I take the opportunity to ask the Prime Minister if he would consider apologising to Brianna Ghey’s mother for his insensitive comment.’ The Prime Minister did conclude his remarks by saying: ‘If I could just say also to Brianna Ghey’s mother who is here, as I said earlier this week, what happened was an unspeakable and shocking tragedy.

(AP Photo/Frank Augstein) Share LONDON - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faced criticism Wednesday after seeking to mock the position of the Labour Party's leader on the definition of a woman, less than two minutes after lawmakers heard that the mother of a murdered transgender teenager was in Parliament. In response to a question from Keir Starmer, Sunak listed a series of issues that he said showed the Labour leader making about-turns, ending with a quip about his stance on ""defining a woman, although in fairness, that was only 99% of a U-turn."" Read more of the latest international headlines His remark was intended to embarrass Starmer, who Sunak's Conservatives have accused of vacillating on the issue of self-identification, and who have pounced on his comment last year that ""99.9% of women haven't got a penis."" Starmer, who had welcomed the mother of Brianna Ghey, Esther Ghey, was visibly furious in response. He said the comments were inappropriate, and Sunak later acknowledged Ghey. ""Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna's mother is in this chamber. Shame,"" Starmer said. ""Parading as a man of integrity when he's got absolutely no responsibility."" Last Friday, the two 16-year-old convicted murderers of Brianna a year ago were handed life sentences with minimum prison terms of 20 and 22 years. The horrific murder shocked the nation. Brianna, who was 16, was stabbed with a hunting knife 28 times in her head, neck, chest and back in broad daylight after being lured to a park in the town of Warrington in northwest England on Feb. 11, 2023. Brianna's mother has been widely praised for her dignified response, calling for the families of the convicted pair to be shown some empathy and compassion. In an interview Sunday with the BBC, she said she would be open to meeting the mother of Scarlett Jenkinson, one of Brianna's two killers who according to the judge in the case was the ringleader. Esther Ghey is campaigning for restrictions on what under-16s can access on their cell phones and for the wider use of mindfulness in schools, as a way to help teachers and children to look after their mental health. At the end of Sunak's weekly -- and often rowdy -- questioning in Parliament, he acknowledged the presence of Brianna's mother in the chamber. ""If I could just say also to Brianna Ghey's mother who is here, as I said earlier this week, what happened was an unspeakable and shocking tragedy,"" he said. ""As I said earlier this week, in the face of that, for her mother to demonstrate the compassion and empathy that she did last weekend, I thought demonstrated the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity.

Read our privacy notice British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faced criticism Wednesday after seeking to mock the position of the Labour Party's leader on the definition of a woman, less than two minutes after lawmakers heard that the mother of a murdered transgender teenager was in Parliament.In response to a question from Keir Starmer, Sunak listed a series of issues that he said showed the Labour leader making about-turns, ending with a quip about his stance on “defining a woman, although in fairness, that was only 99% of a U-turn."" His remark was intended to embarrass Starmer, who Sunak’s Conservatives have accused of vacillating on the issue of self-identification, and who have pounced on his comment last year that “99.9% of women haven’t got a penis.”Starmer, who had welcomed the mother of Brianna Ghey, Esther Ghey, was visibly furious in response. He said the comments were inappropriate, and Sunak later acknowledged Ghey. “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in this chamber. Shame,” Starmer said. “Parading as a man of integrity when he’s got absolutely no responsibility.”Last Friday, the two 16-year-old convicted murderers of Brianna a year ago were handed life sentences with minimum prison terms of 20 and 22 years.The horrific murder shocked the nation. Brianna, who was 16, was stabbed with a hunting knife 28 times in her head, neck, chest and back in broad daylight after being lured to a park in the town of Warrington in northwest England on Feb. 11, 2023.Brianna's mother has been widely praised for her dignified response, calling for the families of the convicted pair to be shown some empathy and compassion. In an interview Sunday with the BBC, she said she would be open to meeting the mother of Scarlett Jenkinson, one of Brianna's two killers who according to the judge in the case was the ringleader.Esther Ghey is campaigning for restrictions on what under-16s can access on their cell phones and for the wider use of mindfulness in schools, as a way to help teachers and children to look after their mental health.At the end of Sunak's weekly — and often rowdy — questioning in Parliament, he acknowledged the presence of Brianna's mother in the chamber.“If I could just say also to Brianna Ghey’s mother who is here, as I said earlier this week, what happened was an unspeakable and shocking tragedy,” he said. “As I said earlier this week, in the face of that, for her mother to demonstrate the compassion and empathy that she did last weekend, I thought demonstrated the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity.“She deserves all our admiration and praise for that,"" he added.Stonewall, a group that stands for LGBTQ+ rights, urged Sunak to apologize for his “cheap, callous and crass” use of trans people as a “punchline.” The exchange has stoked concerns about the level of debate in the run-up to a general election later this year.

Log in here » LONDON (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faced mounting pressure Wednesday to apologize for a remark he made about transgender people, moments after he was informed that the mother of a murdered transgender teenager was in Parliament. During his weekly questioning in the House of Commons, Sunak sought to mock the position of the Labour Party’s leader on the definition of a woman. In response to a question from Keir Starmer, Sunak listed a series of issues that he said showed the Labour leader making about-faces, ending with a quip about his stance on “defining a woman, although in fairness, that was only 99% of a U-turn.” Keir Starmer, Leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party delivers a speech at a business conference in London, Thursday, Feb. 1, 2024. 400 senior business leaders will be in attendance for speeches, panels and roundtables at the Labour Business Conference. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) His remark was intended to embarrass Starmer, who Sunak’s Conservatives have accused of vacillating on the issue of self-identification, and who have pounced on his comment last year that “99.9% of women haven’t got a penis.” Starmer, who had welcomed the mother of Brianna Ghey, Esther Ghey, was visibly furious in response. He said the comments were inappropriate, and Sunak later acknowledged Ghey’s presence, hailing her “compassion and empathy” — but failed to apologize. “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in this chamber. Shame,” Starmer said. “Parading as a man of integrity when he’s got absolutely no responsibility.” Brianna’s father, Peter Spooner, said that he was shocked to hear the remark and urged Sunak to apologize. “As the prime minister for our country to come out with degrading comments like he did, regardless of them being in relation to discussions in Parliament, they are absolutely dehumanizing,” he told Sky News. Stonewall, a group that stands for LGBTQ+ rights, also urged Sunak to apologize for his “cheap, callous and crass” use of trans people as a “punchline.” Last Friday, the two 16-year-old convicted murderers of Brianna a year ago were handed life sentences with minimum prison terms of 20 and 22 years. The horrific murder shocked the nation. Brianna, who was 16, was stabbed with a hunting knife 28 times in her head, neck, chest and back in broad daylight after being lured to a park in the town o f Warrington in northwest England on Feb. 11, 2023. Brianna’s mother has been widely praised for her dignified response, calling for the families of the convicted pair to be shown some empathy and compassion. In an interview Sunday with the BBC, she said she would be open to meeting the mother of Scarlett Jenkinson, one of Brianna’s two killers who according to the judge in the case was the ringleader.

Esther Ghey is campaigning for restrictions on what under-16s can access on their cellphones and for the wider use of mindfulness in schools, as a way to help teachers and children to look after their mental health. Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt rejected a question from a BBC reporter that Sunak chose to use a line about gender as a “political punchline in the presence of a grieving mother.” “That is not what happened,” he said. “What he was saying was that Keir Starmer cannot make his mind up about the big issues of the day.” The exchange between Sunak and Starmer, who met up with Esther Ghey later Wednesday to discuss mental support for children, has stoked concerns about the level of debate before a general election later this year. With his Conservative Party trailing the main opposition Labour Party heavily in the opinion polls, Sunak has come under pressure from some of his own lawmakers to put so-called culture war issues on the agenda, in an attempt to create dividing lines that could begin to dominate the public debate.

He once insisted if he missed his promises, these are the words he used: ‘I am the Prime Minister,’ and then he said: ‘It is on me personally.’“Today, we learn from his own officials that he is the blocker to any deal to end the doctors’ strikes and every time he is asked, he blames everyone else.“So, what exactly did he mean when he said it is on him personally if he doesn’t meet his promise?”Mr Sunak replied: “We are bringing the waiting lists down for the longest waiters and making progress, but it is a bit rich to hear about promises from someone who has broken every single promise he was elected on.Sir Keir Starmer lambasted the Prime Minister (House of Commons/PA)“I think I have counted almost 30 in the last year. Pensions, planning, peerages, public sector pay, tuition fees, childcare, second referendums, defining a woman – although in fairness, that was only 99% of a U-turn.“The list goes on, but the theme is the same: it is empty words, broken promises and absolutely no plan.”Sir Keir hit back, saying: “Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna’s mother is in this chamber. Shame.“Parading as a man of integrity when he’s got absolutely no responsibility.”The Labour leader added: “I think the role of the Prime Minister is to ensure that every single citizen in this country feels safe and respected, it’s a shame that the Prime Minister doesn’t share that.”Sir Keir had opened the session by telling MPs: “This week the unwavering bravery of Brianna Ghey’s mother Esther has touched us all. As a father, I can’t even imagine the pain that she is going through and I am glad that she is with us in the gallery here today.”Mr Sunak was later asked to apologise (House of Commons/PA)Mr Sunak was later asked to apologise to Brianna’s mother for his “insensitive comment”.Labour MP Liz Twist (Blaydon) said: “May I take the opportunity to ask the Prime Minister if he would consider apologising to Brianna Ghey’s mother for his insensitive comment?”Mr Sunak did not directly respond to Ms Twist’s request.Concluding Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Sunak said: “If I could just say also to Brianna Ghey’s mother who is here, as I said earlier this week, what happened was an unspeakable and shocking tragedy.“As I said earlier this week, in the face of that, for her mother to demonstrate the compassion and empathy that she did last weekend, I thought demonstrated the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity.“She deserves all our admiration and praise for that.”Sorry, we are not accepting comments on this article.Similar storiesHundreds of thousands pro-Palestine marchers to protest near Israeli embassyUK News|Just nowYousaf to campaign in Scottish Tory leader’s seatUK News|Just nowScottish Labour MPs should be whipped in Gaza ceasefire vote – SNPUK News|Just nowStarmer set to attend major Munich security conferenceUK News|Just now‘Come together’ Sunak tells Conservatives after twin by-election blowUK News|1 hour agoMost popular1Guess which Shropshire market town ranks as the county's best place to livePlusProperty|18 hours ago2'He was the best boy': Emotional day for Telford zoo as beloved therapy fox dies aged 20PlusTelford|Feb 153Two dangerous drivers jailed for causing crash that killed passenger after car was stolen in TelfordPlusCrime|5 hours ago4Thousands of cannabis plants worth up to £2.5m discovered in abandoned print works in NewportCrime|7 hours ago5Ben Shephard: Leaving ‘on-screen wife’ Kate Garraway for This Morning is hardUK News|4 hours agoFollow us onGet involvedContact usSend us your newsSend us your photosDeliver the Shropshire StarUseful linksMNA Digital ServicesCreate a job alertBook a classified adMaking a complaintGet our appAbout the websiteAbout usTerms of website useCookie policyPrivacy policyAcceptable use policyData protection policyCommunity guidelinesFollow us onFacebookTwitter Back to top© 2024 Shropshire Star.

Poilievre, speaking to reporters in Montreal, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is delivering vague, blanket condemnations of Alberta's policies in order to avoid debating the specifics and losing the debate. Poilievre says parents have to be trusted to know and act on what's in the best interests of their children. Capital Dispatch: Sign up for in-depth political coverage of Parliament Hill He says Trudeau is spreading disinformation in order to ""demonize"" parents and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith. Trudeau and other federal cabinet ministers have criticized the proposed rules, with Trudeau labelling them the ""most anti-LGBT of anywhere in the country."" Smith is proposing to put limits on transgender surgery and hormone therapy, restrict pronoun use and sex education in schools and prevent transgender girls from competing in all-female leagues. Critics say Smith is infringing on medical rights and personal freedoms. She says the rules are about safety and preventing young people from making life-altering decisions they may later regret. Poilievre told reporters Tuesday that Trudeau has suggested parents cannot be trusted with the best interests of their children. ""Trudeau has spread hatred against parents,"" said Poilievre. ""He's accused Muslim parents of being hateful because they were standing up for their kids. He's attacked Christian parents. He has suggested that parents cannot be trusted with their kids. And I disagree with him. ""No one cares for their kids more than parents. And that's why Justin Trudeau should butt out. ""He should let parents raise kids and let provinces run schools and hospitals."" Smith has said the changes would come in during the fall sitting of the Alberta legislature. She has said gender reassignment surgery would be banned for those 17 and under. And there would be no puberty blockers or hormone therapies for the purpose of gender reassignment or affirmation for anyone 15 and under, unless they've already begun such treatments. Parental consent would be required for students 15 and under who want to change their names or pronouns at school. Students 16 and 17 would not need consent, but their parents would have to be notified. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 6, 2023.

(Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)Social SharingConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Wednesday he does not support trans kids taking puberty blockers — medicines that are used to pause puberty before a possible gender transition or other interventions, like hormone therapy.Speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill before a Conservative caucus meeting, Poilievre said the decision to pursue transgender treatments should be reserved to adults alone.""Puberty blockers for minors? I think we should protect children and their ability to make adult decisions when they're adults,"" Poilievre said.""I think we should protect the rights of parents to make their own decisions with regards to their children.""Asked to state definitively if he's opposed to puberty blockers for people under the age of 18, Poilievre said he is.Pierre Poilievre defends Alberta Premier Smith on transgender policiesThat's a step further than what Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has proposed in her province.Smith, who announced a series of transgender policies last week, has pitched restrictions on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for children 15 and under.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has condemned what he describes as Smith's ""anti-LGBT"" policies, which he said could lead to mental health troubles and an increase in suicidal thoughts among teens.""The fact that Premier Smith and Pierre Poilievre want government to take away the option for parents and their vulnerable youth — in consultation with their doctors — to make the right decisions for them is anchored in ideology and is not about protecting the most vulnerable,"" Trudeau told reporters Wednesday.Puberty blockers — hormone-suppressing agents that pause the progression of puberty — are typically prescribed to people in the early stages of puberty to halt unwanted physical changes, such as breast development or facial hair.They are prescribed to children only after consultation with a doctor.They may sometimes be combined with hormone therapies, which can have long-term, irreversible effects.WATCH | Poilievre says he's against puberty blockers for transgender children Poilievre opposes puberty blockers for people people under 189 days agoDuration 2:04Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says he does not support puberty blockers for minors. His comment comes after Alberta's government proposed restricting the medical treatment for children under 15.The Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS) has said that ""gender-affirming medical interventions may be an important component of comprehensive care"" for some transgender or gender-diverse adolescents.The CPS, citing scientific research, has said access to puberty blockers ""has been associated with lower odds of suicidal ideation over the life course.""It has said these drugs should not be prescribed before the onset of puberty for medical reasons — and also because the puberty process is ""an important experience through which young people may develop clearer understanding of their gender identity.""Cross-sex hormone therapy is a treatment used by trans people to transition and to look physically more like the gender with which they identify.Trans men, for example, can take testosterone to help deepen their voices, increase muscle mass and promote body and facial hair.Trans women sometimes use estrogen to increase breast size, reduce male-pattern baldness and reduce testicle size.The CPS says hormone therapy produces both reversible and irreversible changes and should only be provided to young people who ""demonstrate the capacity to understand and appreciate both the benefits and risks of these medications, given their profound effects.""Poilievre said he thinks adults with gender dysphoria should ""have the freedom to make any decision they want about their bodies.""While the national conversation about trans care was prompted by Smith's policy announcement, Poilievre said Trudeau is to blame for whipping up the public and the media.Danielle Smith, Liberals trade shots over transgender policies during her trip to OttawaFederal justice minister accuses Alberta Premier Danielle Smith of 'demonizing' trans kidsPoilievre called trans health care ""a divisive wedge"" that's being used by the Liberal government to ""distract from doubling housing costs and quadrupling carbon taxes.""""Justin Trudeau is puffing out his chest, trying to divide Canadians and attack parents who are trying to protect their kids,"" he said.Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages Minister Randy Boissonnault listens to a question as he speaks with reporters in the Foyer of the House of Commons, Monday, February 5, 2024 in Ottawa. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, a gay man who has become a vocal critic of Smith's plan, has spoken out about Alberta's push to demand that some trans kids get parental consent before using their preferred names and pronouns at school.Boissonnault told reporters Wednesday that neither Poilievre nor Smith should have a say in who should have access to certain treatments.""That's a conversation that should take place between a young person and their doctor,"" he said. ""I don't see MD after Pierre Poilievre's name or Danielle Smith's, so [it's] not their business.""NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh accused Poilievre and Smith of ""attacking vulnerable communities.""""It should be a decision between a person and their health-care provider ... not based on the opinion of Pierre Poilievre,"" Singh told reporters Wednesday.ABOUT THE AUTHORJohn Paul TaskerSenior reporterJ.P.

Log in here » MONTREAL – Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, responding to Alberta’s proposed rules for transgender youth, says the federal government needs to “butt out” of provincial health care and education. Poilievre, speaking to reporters in Montreal, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is delivering vague, blanket condemnations of Alberta’s policies in order to avoid debating the specifics and losing the debate. Poilievre says parents have to be trusted to know and act on what’s in the best interests of their children. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre rises during Question Period on Feb. 6, 2024 in Ottawa. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld He says Trudeau is spreading disinformation in order to “demonize” parents and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith. Trudeau and other federal cabinet ministers have criticized the proposed rules, with Trudeau labelling them the “most anti-LGBT of anywhere in the country.” Smith is proposing to put limits on transgender surgery and hormone therapy, restrict pronoun use and sex education in schools and prevent transgender girls from competing in all-female leagues. Critics say Smith is infringing on medical rights and personal freedoms. She says the rules are about safety and preventing young people from making life-altering decisions they may later regret. Poilievre told reporters Tuesday that Trudeau has suggested parents cannot be trusted with the best interests of their children. “Trudeau has spread hatred against parents,” said Poilievre. “He’s accused Muslim parents of being hateful because they were standing up for their kids. He’s attacked Christian parents. He has suggested that parents cannot be trusted with their kids. And I disagree with him. “No one cares for their kids more than parents. And that’s why Justin Trudeau should butt out. Winnipeg Free Press | Newsletter Business Weekly Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week.

She has said gender reassignment surgery would be banned for those 17 and under. And there would be no puberty blockers or hormone therapies for the purpose of gender reassignment or affirmation for anyone 15 and under, unless they’ve already begun such treatments. Parental consent would be required for students 15 and under who want to change their names or pronouns at school. Students 16 and 17 would not need consent, but their parents would have to be notified. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 6, 2023.

Stephanie Taylor, The Canadian Press Feb 7, 2024 4:15 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre talks to media at a party caucus meeting on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday, Feb.7, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick OTTAWA — The political battle lines over gender identity came into sharper focus Wednesday as Pierre Poilievre came out against treating young people with puberty blockers — a position that prompted a broadside from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The Conservative leader wants to take away the rights of parents and kids alike, Trudeau said after Poilievre finally clarified his stance on the controversial course of gender-affirming therapy. Transgender children are much more likely to attempt suicide, Trudeau said, and governments should not be contemplating ways to take away their medical options. The prime minister also took a swipe at Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who announced plans last week to ban puberty blockers and hormone therapy for children 15 and younger who have not already begun such treatments. Taking those options away from families and their doctors ""is anchored in ideology and is not about protecting the most vulnerable,"" Trudeau said before question period. ""Our government will do whatever it takes to protect the most vulnerable."" Puberty blockers, as they're known, are used to prevent the body from producing the sex hormones that fuel both male and female development. The Alberta Medical Association has released statements voicing concern over Smith's policies, saying transgender and gender-diverse youth who lack access to such care face an increased risk of depression and suicide. Smith also proposes rules that would require parental consent for kids 15 and under who want to go by a different name or pronoun at school. Teens aged 16 and 17 would be able to make such changes without permission, but schools would have to notify their guardians. The proposals have spurred protests in Alberta and Ottawa and drawn condemnation from Liberal politicians including Trudeau, who accuse Smith of pushing an anti-LGBTQ+ agenda. The proposition also triggered a barrage of media questions for Poilievre this week about his views on gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender youth. Asked directly on Wednesday whether he opposes the use of puberty blockers for gender-diverse youth under the age of 18, Poilevre said, ""Yes."" ""We should protect children and their ability to make adult decisions when they're adults,"" he said. For months, the federal Conservative leader has said he supports the rights of parents to raise their children as they wish, and urged Trudeau to ""butt out"" of provincial decisions about schools and hospitals. New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs was the first provincial leader to change the notification policy in schools for gender-diverse children wishing to go by a different name or pronoun. Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe followed his lead last fall. Poilievre said it's the prime minister who is attacking families who are trying to protect their kids. ""He will, in the end, back down on this,"" he said. ""I think we should protect the rights of parents to make their own decisions with regards to their children, and I believe that adults should have the freedom to make any decision they want about their bodies."" Liberal cabinet minister Randy Boissonnault, an openly gay MP who represents an Edmonton riding, paused before the party's weekly caucus meeting Wednesday to deride Poilievre's position. The decision to use puberty blockers should be based on a conversation between a young person and their doctor, Boissonnault said. ""I don't see M.D. after Pierre Poilievre's name or Danielle Smith's,"" he said. ""So, not their business."" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh struck a similar tone, saying health-care decisions should involve an individual and their doctor: ""Based on evidence, based on science, based on best practices and not based on the opinion of Pierre Poilievre."" The Canadian Paediatric Society recommended in a position statement last summer that health care providers should adopt an affirming approach to care for all children and youth and advocate for ""timely access to specialized gender-related care."" The recommendations included ensuring that providers be sufficiently familiar with gender-affirming hormone therapy to discuss benefits and risks of that kind of intervention or ensure timely referral to people who can offer that advice. The executive director of Egale Canada, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, said Poilievre and Smith are ""playing politics with some of the most vulnerable members of our society."" Helen Kennedy said in a written statement that the policy positions run counter to expert guidance, violate the constitutional rights of LGBTQ+ people and ""will lead to irreparable harm and suffering."" Since becoming leader, Poilievre has tried to keep his party focused on cost-of-living issues and crime — two areas the party sees as core to a winning strategy. Some of his supporters, however, have pressed him to veer further into the debate around how schools handle issues of gender diversity and sexual orientation among their students. At last year's policy convention in Quebec City, grassroots party members voted overwhelmingly in favour of a resolution that calls on a future Conservative government to prohibit ""medicinal or surgical interventions"" for gender-diverse and transgender children. Poilievre has yet to say whether he has any plans to ink that party policy into a future election platform. If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, support is available 24/7 by calling or texting 988, the national suicide prevention helpline.

Beginning at 10 a.m., students walked out of their schools to take part in demonstrations against the far-reaching medical intervention policies announced by Premier Danielle Smith. Those proposals include parental approval for sex education, sexual orientation and gender identity. Get local, live and breaking news right to your email inbox. Sign up for our daily newsletter Students from Calgary's Western Canada, Crescent Heights, William Aberhart and Henry Wise Wood schools opted in to the protest, among others. They were joined by teens in Okotoks, Airdrie, Cochrane, Lethbridge, Edmonton and Leduc. ""It's important to me because I am a trans kid and I am personally in a safe situation but I know a lot of people — even at this school — that aren't,"" Grade 12 student Akira Hesslein said. ""(The government is) literally denying us the effectiveness of our health care for the sake of parental rights. ""We're not going to be quiet. This is our fight."" ""(Smith is) taking away the rights of people who haven't done anything wrong,"" Yomade Akapo added. ""It's a violation of human rights. It's absolutely disgusting."" The Calgary Board of Education said it was aware of the demonstrations and wouldn't stop any students from participating. ""We will not prevent students from leaving class during this time; however, any students who were not present in class will be marked as an unexcused absence,"" it said. ""We can't just stand by and watch this awful stuff happen,"" Grade 11 student Rebecca Malach told CTV News. ""It's not right."" Provincial response Smith has said the fall sitting of the legislature would bring new rules, including restrictions on youth changing their names or pronouns at school and getting hormone therapy or gender reassignment surgery. Her education minister defended the policies to media Wednesday. ""We understand that there are a diverse range of opinions and that's ok,"" Demetrios Nicolaides said. ""It's important to have these kinds of conversations."" Critics have lamented over what they call a complete lack of consultation. When asked about who was spoken to before the announcement, Nicolaides pointed to meetings he had over the weekend and on Monday. He promised to engage more ""with partners to ensure that these policies are implemented in the most efficient manner possible."" Smith has claimed the long-term goal is to ensure children are ""fully informed"" about the decisions they are making because they might regret them later in life. In defending her proposals during a trip to Ottawa on Monday, the premier said there is no ""single voice"" that can speak on behalf of the entire transgender community. She said she has spoken to some transgender people who expressed concerns about the ability of children to transition at a young age. ""We had to have a conversation about what is the appropriate age to be able to make those life-altering decisions,"" she said. Lethbridge participates At 10 a.m., students from Lethbridge Collegiate Institute (LCI) began to file outside and across the street. Dozens took part, chanting and giving speeches in opposition of the UCP's proposed gender identity policies. ""My biggest thing with wanting to come out here to start up these protests was really just to try to empower students and show that everyone has a really great voice and a really powerful voice,"" said LCI student and walkout organizer Kaz Raham. Across the city, students at Chinook High School staged a similar event. Several expressed concern over the new policies' potential to harm trans students. ""It's just dangerous in general, this bill. I have friends, who will not be named, who would in fact be in danger if they were exposed to their parents in any form,"" said Chinook High School student Shev Twedt. Some students support the new policies and believe teenagers are too young to be making decisions about their gender identity. ""A child is not at the full mind capacity to make a decision like that. I wouldn't want to make a decision like that,"" said Jaydan Miranda, a student at LCI. Those protesting the government's actions were happy with the turnouts they saw and plan to continue.

Smith said the fall sitting of the legislature would bring new rules, including restrictions on youth changing their names or pronouns at school, as well as on hormone treatment and surgery for gender affirmation. She said the goal of the policies is to ensure children are ""fully informed"" about the decisions they are making because they might regret them later in life. The policies spurred a week of protest — both at the grassroots level and from groups like the Alberta Medical Association. Students at high schools in Edmonton and Calgary also walked out Wednesday. In Calgary, several dozen students from Western Canada High School carried signs with messages such as ""Our Outrage Does Not Fit on a Poster"" and ""Protect Trans Black Female Disabled Immigrant Queer Indigenous Refugee Youth."" Yomade Akapo, 16, said Smith's government is ""taking away rights from people who haven't done anything wrong. ""It's just a violation of human rights. It's absolutely disgusting that that's something she could to do to thousands of trans kids. I don't think she understands how she's affecting these kids, how she's affecting their mental health."" Fletcher Morrison, a transgender boy in Grade 11, said it's important that his and others' rights are respected at their schools. ""I just want everyone to feel safe in school,"" said the 16-year-old who transitioned three years ago with the support of his friends and family. Morrison said he's been seeing a lot more anti-transgender arguments in the past week. ""I can see it getting worse,"" he said. ""I just am worried for the safety of youth."" A few people stopped on the street in front of the high school to support the students. Kathryn Smith, a non-binary trans and queer adult, works with a lot of transgender youth. ""I wanted to come out and show the kids there are adults who support and love them,"" Smith said. ""It's very hard to see what's happening."" Back in Leduc, Cervo said he used to be transgender but now considers himself gender-fluid. He said he mostly goes by ""he,"" but it sometimes changes. When asked whether his fluidity could support arguments that youth who receive gender-affirming care could later change their minds, Cervo said that no one in Alberta is getting genital reconstruction surgery before 18 because it's such a big change. Other types of gender-affirming care, such as hormone therapy that his brother has been waiting for to change his voice, are decisions that Cervo felt his brother and others his age are old enough to make for themselves. ""He's been waiting for gender-affirming care for two years now and these policies are going to have to make him wait until he's at least 16,"" Cervo said. ""He's been waiting for so long and now he's going to have to wait longer."" Smith said gender affirmation surgery would be banned for those 17 and under. And there would be no puberty blockers or hormone therapies for the purpose of gender affirmation for anyone 15 and under, unless they’ve already begun such treatments. Parental consent would be required for students 15 and under who want to change their names or pronouns at school. Students 16 and 17 would not need consent, but their parents would have to be notified. Smith, in defending her proposals during a trip to Ottawa on Monday, said there is no ""single voice"" that can speak on behalf of the entire transgender community. She said she has spoken to some transgender people who expressed concerns about the ability of children to transition at a young age. ""We had to have a conversation about what is the appropriate ages to be able to make those life-altering decisions."" This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 7, 2024.

(Jason Franson/ The Canadian Press)Social SharingThere needs to be more consultations with stakeholders from the 2SLGBTQ+ community regarding Premier Danielle Smith's policy changes affecting transgender and non-binary youth, an Alberta cabinet minister said Tuesday.Tanya Fir, Alberta's minister of arts, culture and status of women, met with 2SLGBTQ+ community groups in Edmonton on Tuesday to discuss gender policies affecting transgender and non-binary youth.It was the first time someone from the government had met with Edmonton stakeholders since Smith announced her government would implement a slate of policies and guidelines around gender identity, gender affirmation surgeries and new rules for transgender women athletes.Danielle Smith unveils sweeping changes to Alberta's student gender identity, sports and surgery policiesAlberta premier says legislation on gender policies for children, youth coming this fallSpeaking to reporters Tuesday, Fir said meeting with stakeholders in Edmonton was important.""There needs to be further consultation,"" she said. ""I want to continue the consultation and I want to continue the dialogue.""Smith's policy proposals have drawn criticism from 2SLGBTQ+ advocates, Alberta's Official Opposition and the federal Liberal government, but have been defended by parent groups and federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.Trudeau says Premier Smith's new transgender policies target 'vulnerable' youthPierre Poilievre defends Alberta Premier Smith on transgender policiesUnder the proposed guidelines, gender-affirming surgeries would be banned for minors aged 17 and under. Puberty blockers and hormone therapies also would not be permitted for children aged 15 and under.Parental notification and consent would be required for schools to alter the name or pronouns of any child under age 15. Parents also would have to ""opt-in"" their children when teachers plan to teach about gender identity, sexual orientation or sexuality.Transgender women will be banned from competing in women's sports leagues.Fir, who told stakeholders she supports Smith's policy proposals, said the meeting had been delayed until after Smith's announcement so stakeholders in Edmonton could learn about the policies first before sharing their thoughts.Alberta to put limits on gender-affirming care for trans youth16 days agoDuration 2:07Alberta Premier Danielle Smith announced policy changes that would put minimum legal age limits on surgeries and hormone therapies for transgender youth. It will also require parental notification — and permission, depending on the student's age — if a student wants to change their name or pronoun at school.Fir said the policies and guidelines are compassionate and balanced, noting Smith's commitment to bringing in counselling for families and trans youth, and recruiting medical professionals skilled in gender-affirming surgeries to practice in Alberta.""When we talk about these decisions, some of these are life altering, irreversible decisions that can affect reproductive health going forward,"" she said.Fir said there would be further consultations with the ministries of health, education and sport.CBC News requested comment from the province to ask what consultations would be happening and with whom.In an emailed statement, Sam Blackett, press secretary for the premier's office, said the province is still in the early development stages of these policies. He said officials need to engage with various stakeholders to determine exactly how they would be implemented.""More information will be shared when it's available,"" Blackett said.Premier Smith defends proposed new gender policies during Ottawa visit11 days agoDuration 2:58Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, visiting Ottawa to open a new provincial office, says her planned policy changes on gender identity are part of 'a debate that we have to have.'Kevin Lee, press secretary for the minister of Tourism and Sport, said in an email to CBC News some policy implementation will require consultation and feedback from various stakeholders, including provincial sport organizations.""Minister [Joseph} Schow will work through this process, together with the premier and his cabinet colleagues, with the goal of having these policies fully implemented by the end of the year,"" he said.Advocates who participated in Tuesday's meeting, which is part of a series of consultations Fir has been holding with 2SLGBTQ+ communities since last year, said they should have been consulted before Smith went public with the plan.Doctors, nurses and medical groups urge province to walk back plans to limit gender-affirming careParents of transgender kids want Alberta government to stay out of medical decisionsKristopher Wells, Canada Research Chair for the Public Understanding of Sexual and Gender Minority Youth at MacEwan University in Edmonton, said some asked for Fir to resign ""given the harm that these policies will do to young people.""He told CBC News after the meeting Fir did not provide any evidence used to develop the policies.""It's clear [the premier] had no consultation with her own ministers because they know nothing about these policies,"" Wells said.""The minister was asked if she is prepared to have blood on her hands when these policies are enacted and 2SLGBTQ young people take their own lives. That is what is at stake here.""Transgender columnist has mixed reaction to Alberta's policy changes14 days agoDuration 6:21Julia Malott, a transgender columnist, says she supports parts of Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's planned gender identity policy changes but that 'more nuance' is needed in some areas, such as the issue of hormone therapies.Wells said those in the meeting called on the provincial government to provide more access for 2SLGBTQ+ health, including a small number of people who need access to gender-affirming care. Cheyenne Mihko Kihêw, executive director of the Edmonton 2 Spirit Society, said it seemed ""a little ironic"" that the province wanted to consult stakeholders after the policies had already been created.Kihêw said groups and individuals that were consulted didn't reflect the majority of the 2SLGBTQ+ community. They wish the premier had been present for the meeting to hear from community members who will be most affected by her decisions.""If she was an active ally of our community, then she would have been in that meeting,"" Kihêw said.Kihêw said they hope the government will continue to hear the voices of the 2SLGBTQ+ community, but noted a number of organizations, including those serving youth, weren't invited to Tuesday's meeting. ""Where were the youth at this conversation? None of them were at the table,"" they said.""We're, as adults, trying to use our voices to speak up for the youth, but we should be … allowing them to speak for themselves.""ABOUT THE AUTHORAaron SousaReporterAaron is a reporter with CBC Edmonton.

Back to Reading Published Feb. 7, 2024, 5:33 p.m. ET Explore More Snoop Dogg’s brother, Bing Worthington, dead at 44 Nick Carter’s sister Bobbie Jean Carter’s cause of death revealed ‘Pose’ star Cecilia Gentili dead at 52: ‘Such a fierce advocate’ “Pose” actress Cecilia Gentili, who was a well-known transgender activist, died on Tuesday, Feb. 6. She was 52. Gentili’s death was announced in a statement shared on her Instagram page. “Our beloved Cecilia Gentili passed away this morning to continue watching over us in spirit,” the statement read. “Please be gentle with each other and love one another with ferocity. We will be sharing more updates about services and what is to come in the following days. At this time, we’re asking for privacy, time and space to grieve.” The Post has reached out to reps for Gentili for comment. Born in Argentina, Gentili first came out in 1984. She was a former sex worker who admitted to living in the US ‘undocumented’ for ten years. She received asylum in the United States in 2012. Afterward, she was inspired to help others with similar pasts, causing her to fight for the rights of undocumented immigrants, sex workers and the LGBTQIA+ community. 4 Cecilia Gentili speaks at a press conference about safe consumption spaces (supervised injection facilities) on April 5, 2018, at the steps of City Hall. Activists carried “End Overdose NY” banners. LightRocket via Getty Images Gentili served as the director of policy at GMHC, the world’s first and leading provider of HIV/AIDS prevention, care and advocacy from 2016 to 2019. In 2019, she founded Trans Equity Consulting, which “was committed to building the leadership of trans women of color, and to the centering of sex workers, immigrants and incarcerated peoples as experts in creating a more just world.” She then co-founded Transmissions Fest, the first all-trans music festival in New York City, which was held on June 21, 2022. Proceeds benefitted multiple LGBTQ+ charities. “We are often included in Pride events, but we’re not centered,” she told Them of the rationale for the event. “And there’s a difference.” 4 On the critically acclaimed FX series “Pose,” which ran from 2018 to 2021, Gentili played Miss Orlando, a New York City woman who provided discounted plastic surgery. On the critically acclaimed FX series “Pose,” which ran from 2018 to 2021, Gentili played Miss Orlando, a New York City woman who provided discounted plastic surgery. After news of her death was confirmed on social media, hundreds of fans immediately reacted to the sad news. “Our community will never be the same without you, Cecilia,” wrote US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Thank you for giving us so much, relentlessly, every single day. You transformed so many lives and shined a light across Jackson Heights, Corona and beyond.” Her “Pose” co-star, Tobago trans model Dominique Jackson, posted a tribute on Tuesday, sharing that she was “deeply saddened” by Gentili’s passing. 4 Cecilia Gentili attends an after-party for HBO Documentary Films’ the Stroll at Whitney Museum on June 5, 2023, in New York City. Getty Images for HBO “I am deeply saddened by your departure dear sister!” she wrote. “Even in death you are force to be reckoned with, your legacy one of movement, love and compassion unapologetic and true. I thank you dearly for ALL the work you have done. You sacrificed you boldly telling your truth and living it and for that you have changed and influenced many lives and the world. I LOVE YOU FOREVER BEAUTIFUL STRONG SISTER! REST WELL!” Angelica Ross, “Pose” actress and founder and CEO of TransTech Social Enterprises, a firm that helps employ transgender people in the tech industry, also commented on Gentili’s passing saying, “Such a fierce advocate. Rest in Power.” Drag performer Chiquitita also paid tribute and posted a video of the pair onstage together, writing, “I will honor your name for the rest of my life. Thank you for everything. Thank you for being a mother to me.” 4 On the critically acclaimed FX series, which ran from 2018 to 2021, Gentili played Miss Orlando, a New York City woman who provided discounted plastic surgery. Instagram / @ceciliagentili72 In addition to being an actress and activist, Gentili was an author and she published “Faltas: Letters to Everyone in My Hometown Who Isn’t My Rapist” in 2022. “I love telling stories,” she told Them in an interview. “I’ve been telling the same stories for 10 fucking years, right? But my stories are always different. Depending on where I am, how I feel, who’s listening, I tell the stories differently. If I feel like people need a little bit of compassion, I can put compassion in my story. If I feel like people need to hear the hard truth, I can be hardcore. With the book, you lose that. There is only one way and it’s on paper. So when I started writing these stories, I hated it.” “But then it was like, What about if I write a letter? It was Cat [Fitzpatrick, of LittlePuss Press] who taught me that. What if the stories are part of a letter? And it was such a beautiful discovery,” she added. “Because then the story is not about the story. It’s the message you want to translate to that person.” In 2023, the book won the American Library Association’s Stonewall Book Award.

WongSenior Culture Reporter, HuffPostFeb 7, 2024, 06:14 PM ESTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGCecilia Gentili, a renowned LGBTQ+ rights advocate, author and actor best known for her portrayal of Miss Orlando on “Pose,” has died. She was 52. Gentili’s death was confirmed in a post shared on her Instagram account late Tuesday.“Our beloved Cecilia Gentili passed away this morning to continue watching over us in spirit,” the post read. “Please be gentle with each other and love one another with ferocity.”Advertisement A cause of death was not announced.The news prompted an outpouring of tributes from elected officials as well as fellow advocates.“New York’s LGBTQ+ community has lost a champion in trans icon Cecilia Gentili,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “As an artist and steadfast activist in the trans rights movement, she helped countless people find love, joy, and acceptance. Our hearts are with her loved ones in this difficult time.” At the time of Cecilia Gentili's death, the LGBTQ+ rights advocate, author and actor had been planning to return to the New York stage.Slaven Vlasic via Getty ImagesGLAAD CEO and President Sarah Kate Ellis expressed similar sentiments.“Cecilia Gentili’s death is such a huge loss,” she wrote. “She impacted so many, especially those in the trans community in New York City and beyond. This is the power of one person who used her identity and gifts to help more people be seen and heard.”In an Instagram post, actor Dominique Jackson referred to her “Pose” co-star as a “dear sister” and a “force to be reckoned with.” Advertisement “You sacrificed you boldly telling your truth and living it and for that you have changed and influenced many lives and the world,” she added. Gentili, who was born in Argentina, relocated to the U.S. at age 26 in hopes of being able to safely live her truth as a transgender woman, residing first in Florida and later New York. She supported herself largely though sex work.A brief stint in jail on drug possession charges convinced Gentili to focus on recovery and pursue a career in public health. After working with Apicha Community Health Center and GMHC (formerly the Gay Men’s Health Crisis), she founded Trans Equity Consulting, an advocacy group focused on developing LGBTQ-affirming services in the workplace, in 2019. In 2021, she unveiled Cecilia’s Occupational Inclusion Network, which provides free health care for sex workers, through a partnership with Callen-Lorde Community Health Center. ""I never want to judge my work by how 'radical' I am. But I do judge it on what I’m doing for my people and for myself,"" wrote Gentili, seen here in 2019.Erik McGregor via Getty ImagesAfter appearing in four episodes of “Pose” from 2018 to 2021, Gentili began devoting more time to artistic pursuits. In 2022, she published “Faltas: Letters to Everyone in My Hometown Who Isn’t My Rapist,” a memoir of her early years. This April, she planned to return to the stage for an encore presentation of “Red Ink,” an autobiographical one-woman show that debuted last year in New York.Advertisement In an essay for the 2023 anthology “Surviving Transphobia,” Gentili shrugged off the label of “radical” for her life’s work.“I say this to trans people, trans women of color, and to trans women of color who are undocumented or sex workers or both, people like me: Do what you can to achieve whatever level of empowerment you can get, but also be safe,” she wrote. “I’ll probably never call myself radical, especially in two countries with such high rates of trans femicide and histories of coups.”“I never want to judge my work by how ‘radical’ I am,” she added. “But I do judge it on what I’m doing for my people and for myself.”Support HuffPostOur 2024 Coverage Needs YouAt HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

She supported herself in New York City through sex work, where she was exposed to drug abuse, and eventually became incarcerated at Rikers in 2009. All of this led to the creation of Trans Equity Consulting in 2019, an organization she founded dedicated to uplifting transwomen of color and “centering of sex workers, immigrants and incarcerated peoples as experts in creating a more just world.” Gentili was no stranger to the arts; she starred as Miss Orlando on Pose and premiered her own one-woman show, Red Ink, last year. With Trans Equity Consulting, she created TRANSMISSION, NYC’s first transgender music festival. She documented the first 17 years of her life in Argentina in her memoir, Faltas: Letters to Everyone in My Hometown Who Isn’t My Rapist, filled with eight letters to people who shaped her childhood, winning the Israel Fishman Nonfiction Award. “Cecilia Gentili’s death is such a huge loss. She impacted so many, especially those in the trans community in New York City and beyond. This is the power of one person who used her identity and gifts to help more people be seen and heard,” wrote GLAAD CEO Sarah Kate Ellis on her death. Below are more tributes to Gentili. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chiquitita (@chiquitettas) Cecilia Gentili was a living legend. A titan, an unapologetic example of trans joy and power. Her spirit lives on in all whom she touched and all she built for us. Rest powerfully and peacefully, Mami. And go kiki with the ancestors. You deserve eternal pleasure. 🙏🏽 pic.twitter.com/ECLxZOpWNu— Raquel Willis (she/her) (@RaquelWillis_) February 7, 2024 Words can not express the impact @CeciliaGentili had on this world. Her humor, her wit, her ability to light up a room and to speak truth to power. She embodied grace & beauty. She was a mother to so many. Her friendship & support over the years meant more than I can ever say. 💔 pic.twitter.com/a9qmS2ME2L— Marti (@MartiGCummings) February 6, 2024 Cecilia Gentili’s death is such a huge loss.

Kristi Noem and her health secretary last year after the state terminated a contract with it.Attorneys for the Transformation Project announced the settlement Monday. The nonprofit sued last year after the state canceled the contract for a community health worker in December 2022. The contract included a roughly $136,000 state-administered federal grant, about $39,000 of which the group received, according to its attorneys.The organization alleged the state’s decision “was based purely on national politics,” citing Noem’s statement to conservative media outlet The Daily Signal that the state government shouldn’t participate in the group’s efforts. The outlet had asked Noem about the group and one of its events. “This settlement marks a significant milestone in our ongoing commitment to civil rights advocacy,” lead attorney Brendan Johnson said. “We commend the resiliency of the LGBTQ community and remain committed to vigorously upholding their rights.” READ MORE A former South Dakota attorney general urges the state Supreme Court to let him keep his law license Noem fills 2 legislative seats after South Dakota Supreme Court opinion on legislator conflicts South Dakota deputy killed on duty honored with flashing emergency lights, packed stadium The apology, in a letter dated Jan. 18 and signed by South Dakota Secretary of Health Melissa Magstadt, reads: “On behalf of the State of South Dakota, I apologize that the Transformation Project’s contract was terminated and for treating the Transformation Project differently than other organizations awarded Community Health Worker contracts. “I want to emphasize that all South Dakotans are entitled to equal treatment under the law — regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, disability, age, or sex. South Dakota is committed to ensuring that no person is excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subject to discrimination under any program, activity, or service that it provides,” she wrote.Transformation Project Executive Director Susan Williams said she is glad the lawsuit is over and “it feels good to know that we won.”“I would say that we settled with the apology. It would have been nice to have the apology come from our governor,” she said. Magstadt was not health secretary at the time the contract was terminated. Her predecessor announced her retirement days after the state terminated the contract. The Transformation Project had hired a community health worker before the state ended the contract.The state alleged contract violations in a letter from the deputy secretary noticing the termination. The group said it had complied.Spokespersons for Noem and the state Department of Health did not immediately respond to email requests for comment on the settlement.Transformation Project Community Health Worker/Project Coordinator Jack Fonder said in a statement: “I assumed the role of CHW with the intention of providing trans people in our community with the resources they require to succeed in this state, little realizing that doing so would result in my own outing as a trans man for standing up for what is right. We promise to keep up the battle for transgender rights and to make sure they have access to the resources they require.”Fundraising helped continue Fonder’s position, Williams said. Fonder helps transgender people find shelter, housing and employment, as well as support with legal paperwork and driving people to appointments, among other needs. Williams said the organization would apply for future grants from the state, and she hopes similar groups “will feel more confident” to apply, too.The nonprofit offers help for LGBTQ+ people and their families, such as suicide prevention and guiding people through health care and social services, and educates about gender identity.South Dakota and other Republican-led states have passed laws in recent years that have raised complaints about discrimination against transgender people, such as restricting school sports participation and banning gender-affirming care for kids.

Osoby określające się jako transseksualne nie mają wstępu w szeregi wojska – dotychczas była to oczywistość. Jednak w trakcie rządów ekipy Donalda Tuska i jego koalicjantów może dojść również do takiej rewolucji. Wesprzyj nas już teraz! 25 zł 50 zł 100 zł Wspieram Resort obrony na czele z Władysławem Kosiniakiem-Kamyszem „analizuje” możliwość zmiany przepisów kwalifikujących zaburzenia tożsamości płciowej jako należące do kategorii „choroba i ułomność”. Wynika tak z odpowiedzi MON na zapytanie portalu gazeta.pl. „Propozycje zmian w sprawie orzekania o zdolności do służby wojskowej i trybu postępowania wojskowych komisji lekarskich w sprawach osób transseksualnych i osób interpłciowych były zgłaszane w uzgodnieniach wewnątrzresortowych, jednak nie zostały one zaakceptowane przez ówczesne kierownictwo MON” – napisało biuro prasowe Centrum Operacyjnego ministerstwa. W odpowiedzi znalazła się też obietnica, którą wszyscy troszczący się o kondycję moralną armii powinni potraktować jako ostrzeżenie. „Pragniemy jednak zapewnić, że problem utrudnionego dostępu do służby wojskowej dla osób transseksualnych i osób interpłciowych traktujemy poważnie i analizujemy możliwość zmian zapisów w tym zakresie” – dodał bowiem sztab medialny CO MON. W 2020 roku rzecznik praw obywatelskich, a obecnie minister sprawiedliwości Adam Bodnar w liście do min. Mariusza Błaszczaka ubolewał, że tak zwane osoby transpłciowe „mają utrudniony dostęp do służby wojskowej”. Apelował też o zmianę tego stanu rzeczy. Źródło: DoRzeczy.pl, PCh24.pl RoM Wesprzyj nas!

James Martin, a Jesuit who is one of the country’s most prominent advocates for greater LGBTQ+ inclusion in the Catholic Church.Outreach, a ministry of the Jesuit magazine America, sponsored conferences in New York City in 2022 and 2023, and last year launched a multifaceted website with news, essays and information about Catholic LGBTQ+ resources and events. On Tuesday, there was another milestone for Outreach — the appointment of journalist and author Michael O’Loughlin as its first executive director. O’Loughlin, a former staff writer at online newspaper Crux, has been the national correspondent at America. He is the author of a book recounting the varied ways that Catholics in the U.S. responded to the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and ‘90s — “Hidden Mercy: AIDS, Catholics, and the Untold Stories of Compassion in the Face of Fear.” O’Loughlin told The Associated Press he’s excited by his new job, viewing it as a chance to expand the range of Outreach’s programs and the national scope of its community. “It’s an opportunity to highlight the ways LGBT people can be Catholic and active in parishes, ministries and charities,” he said. “There’s a lot of fear about to being too public about it. ... I want them to realize they’re not alone.”O’Loughlin says his current outlook evolved as he traveled to scores of places around the U.S. to promote his book, talking to groups of LGBTQ+ Catholics, and their families and friends, about how to make the church more welcoming to them. Those conversations made O’Loughlin increasingly comfortable publicly identifying as a gay Catholic after years of wondering whether he should remain in the church. Its doctrine still condemns any sexual relations between gay or lesbian partners as “intrinsically disordered.”The latest expansion of Outreach occurs amid a time of division within the global Catholic Church as it grapples with LGBTQ+ issues. Pope Francis, a Jesuit who has met with Martin and sent letters of support to Outreach, has made clear he favors a more welcoming approach to LGBTQ+ people. At his direction, the Vatican recently gave priests greater leeway to bless same-sex couples and asserted that transgender people, in some circumstances, can be baptized.However, there has been some resistance to the pope’s approach. Many conservative bishops in Africa, Europe and elsewhere said they would not implement the new policy regarding blessings. In the U.S., some bishops have issued directives effectively ordering diocesan personnel not to recognize transgender people’s gender identity.Amid those conflicting developments, Martin and other Jesuit leaders are proud of Outreach’s accomplishments and optimistic about its future. “There seems to be deep hunger for the kind of ministry that we’re doing, not only among LGBTQ Catholics, but also their families and friends,” Martin said by email from Ireland, where he was meeting last week with the the country’s Catholic bishops.“Pope Francis has been very encouraging, allowing himself to be interviewed by Outreach and sending personal greetings to our conference last year,” Martin added. “Perhaps the most surprising support has been from several bishops who have written for our website, as well as some top-notch Catholic theologians who see the need for serious theological reflection on LGBTQ topics.”Martin will remain engaged in Outreach’s oversight, holding the title of founder.The Rev. Brian Paulson, president of the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States, evoked both Jesus and the pope when asked why his order had embraced the mission of Outreach.“Pope Francis has repeatedly called leaders in the Catholic church to emulate the way Jesus spent his ministry on the peripheries, accompanying those who had experienced exclusion,” Paulson said email. “I think the work of Outreach is a response to this invitation.” Paulson also said he was impressed by Martin’s “grace and patience” in responding to the often harsh criticism directed at him by some conservative Catholics.There was ample evidence of Outreach’s stature at its conference last June at a branch of Fordham University in New York City. The event was preceded by a handwritten letter of support sent to Martin by Pope Francis, extending “prayers and good wishes” to the participants.“It’s a special grace for LGBTQ Catholics to know that the pope is praying for them,” Martin said.Another welcoming letter came from Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York.“It is the sacred duty of the Church and Her ministers to reach out to those on the periphery,” he wrote to the conference attendees. The keynote speakers included Fordham’s president, Tania Tetlow, and the closing Mass was celebrated by Archbishop John Wester of Santa Fe, New Mexico.___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Log in here » NEW YORK (AP) — Even as Catholic dogma continues to repudiate same-sex marriage and gender transition, one of the most prominent religious orders in the United States — the Jesuits — is strengthening a unique outreach program for LGBTQ+ Catholics. The initiative — fittingly called Outreach — was founded two years ago by the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit who is one of the country’s most prominent advocates for greater LGBTQ+ inclusion in the Catholic Church. Outreach, a ministry of the Jesuit magazine America, sponsored conferences in New York City in 2022 and 2023, and last year launched a multifaceted website with news, essays and information about Catholic LGBTQ+ resources and events. In this photo provided by America Media, from left, the Rev. James Martin, Archbishop John Wester of Santa Fe, N.M., and Rev. Eric Andrews attend the closing Mass for the Outreach conference at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle, in New York, June 18, 2023. Martin is the founder of Outreach, a unique Jesuit-run program of outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics. (Cristobal Spielmann/America Media via AP) On Tuesday, there was another milestone for Outreach — the appointment of journalist and author Michael O’Loughlin as its first executive director. O’Loughlin, a former staff writer at online newspaper Crux, has been the national correspondent at America. He is the author of a book recounting the varied ways that Catholics in the U.S. responded to the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and ‘90s — “Hidden Mercy: AIDS, Catholics, and the Untold Stories of Compassion in the Face of Fear.” O’Loughlin told The Associated Press he’s excited by his new job, viewing it as a chance to expand the range of Outreach’s programs and the national scope of its community. “It’s an opportunity to highlight the ways LGBT people can be Catholic and active in parishes, ministries and charities,” he said. “There’s a lot of fear about to being too public about it. … I want them to realize they’re not alone.” O’Loughlin says his current outlook evolved as he traveled to scores of places around the U.S. to promote his book, talking to groups of LGBTQ+ Catholics, and their families and friends, about how to make the church more welcoming to them. Those conversations made O’Loughlin increasingly comfortable publicly identifying as a gay Catholic after years of wondering whether he should remain in the church. Its doctrine still condemns any sexual relations between gay or lesbian partners as “intrinsically disordered.” The latest expansion of Outreach occurs amid a time of division within the global Catholic Church as it grapples with LGBTQ+ issues. Pope Francis, a Jesuit who has met with Martin and sent letters of support to Outreach, has made clear he favors a more welcoming approach to LGBTQ+ people. At his direction, the Vatican recently gave priests greater leeway to bless same-sex couples and asserted that transgender people, in some circumstances, can be baptized. However, there has been some resistance to the pope’s approach. Many conservative bishops in Africa, Europe and elsewhere said they would not implement the new policy regarding blessings. In the U.S., some bishops have issued directives effectively ordering diocesan personnel not to recognize transgender people’s gender identity. Amid those conflicting developments, Martin and other Jesuit leaders are proud of Outreach’s accomplishments and optimistic about its future. “There seems to be deep hunger for the kind of ministry that we’re doing, not only among LGBTQ Catholics, but also their families and friends,” Martin said by email from Ireland, where he was meeting last week with the the country’s Catholic bishops. “Pope Francis has been very encouraging, allowing himself to be interviewed by Outreach and sending personal greetings to our conference last year,” Martin added. “Perhaps the most surprising support has been from several bishops who have written for our website, as well as some top-notch Catholic theologians who see the need for serious theological reflection on LGBTQ topics.” Martin will remain engaged in Outreach’s oversight, holding the title of founder. The Rev. Brian Paulson, president of the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States, evoked both Jesus and the pope when asked why his order had embraced the mission of Outreach. “Pope Francis has repeatedly called leaders in the Catholic church to emulate the way Jesus spent his ministry on the peripheries, accompanying those who had experienced exclusion,” Paulson said email. “I think the work of Outreach is a response to this invitation.” Paulson also said he was impressed by Martin’s “grace and patience” in responding to the often harsh criticism directed at him by some conservative Catholics. There was ample evidence of Outreach’s stature at its conference last June at a branch of Fordham University in New York City. The event was preceded by a handwritten letter of support sent to Martin by Pope Francis, extending “prayers and good wishes” to the participants. “It’s a special grace for LGBTQ Catholics to know that the pope is praying for them,” Martin said.

Another welcoming letter came from Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York. “It is the sacred duty of the Church and Her ministers to reach out to those on the periphery,” he wrote to the conference attendees. The keynote speakers included Fordham’s president, Tania Tetlow, and the closing Mass was celebrated by Archbishop John Wester of Santa Fe, New Mexico. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

This counseling included “sending her resources for medical transition,” while the middle-school girl’s “mental condition got worse.”The young girl resisted going to school, became anxious, and began to speak negatively about herself. Her mother became so desperate to find out what was wrong that she took a job driving the school bus.“By concealing from Mrs. Vitsaxaki this important information about her daughter, the School District betrayed Mrs. Vitsaxaki’s trust. It also violated the U.S. Constitution,” the complaint reads.The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the mother by Alliance Defending Freedom, whose senior counsel, Kate Anderson, said that the U.S. Constitution grants parents the right to make decisions about their children’s upbringing, education, and health care.“Parents, not the government, have the right to direct the upbringing, education, and health care of their children,” Ms. Anderson said in a statement.“Parents should be able to drop their kids off at school without fear that school staff will conceal critical information or cut them out of weighty decisions with the potential for life-long impact on their kids.“Because school officials concealed their actions from Mrs. Vitsaxaki, they prevented her from helping her daughter at a time when she needed her mother’s loving guidance most. Schools shouldn’t hide important information from parents like Mrs. Vitsaxaki,” Ms. Anderson added.When Ms. Vitsaxaki confronted school officials, they defended their actions, citing district policy, according to her lawyers.School officials continued to call her daughter by a boy’s name even after Ms. Vitsaxaki told them to stop and removed her from in-person schooling to finish the school year online, according to the lawyers. The mother ultimately enrolled her daughter in a private school some 25 miles away.The Epoch Times contacted the Skaneateles Central School District for comment.

Represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, Jennifer Vitsaxaki of New York filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Skaneateles Central School District and Board of Education, accusing them of violating her constitutional rights through their deception and their social transitioning of her 12-year-old daughter, Jane. The Daily Signal first obtained the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. Skaneateles, New York, where the school district is located, is about 22 miles southwest of Syracuse. “Parents have the right to direct the upbringing and education of their kids, and they cannot fulfill those responsibilities when schools hide information from them and make critical decisions that can have lifelong consequences for their child,” said Kate Anderson, senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom. “So, this case is important to ensure that all parents can have the information they need to do what’s best for their kids.” Though Michael Vitsaxaki and Jennifer Vitsaxaki are both U.S. citizens, the Vitsaxaki family had spent almost a decade in Greece, where the Vitsaxaki parents were from, and Jane’s primary language was Greek. The family decided to leave Greece when its economy collapsed and they realized that they could not continue raising their children there, but the transition from their closely knit community in Greece to the U.S. was disruptive to the entire family’s lives. Young Jane Vitsaxaki had to adapt to a “new culture, including learning to go through each day speaking primarily English instead of Greek,” and her father’s job required him to frequently travel out of the country. The complaint states that Jennifer Vitsaxaki began to be increasingly concerned as her daughter was exhibiting signs of anxiety and depression and occasionally refusing to leave home. The mother repeatedly asked school district employees about whether they had noticed anything troubling her daughter, but was met with denials and assurances that her daughter was fine. “Those repeated reassurances concealed the truth,” the complaint states. “While school officials kept telling Mrs. Vitsaxaki that there was nothing to report, a school counselor was regularly meeting with her daughter and her peers to address ongoing bullying suffered by … Jane, and other girls in the group.” Worse than that, the complaint said, the district began treating Jane as though she were a boy—”just as it had done with several other girls in her grade.” “The same counselor instructed school staff to treat Mrs. Vitsaxaki’s daughter as though she were a boy by referring to her with a boy’s name and the third-person plural pronouns ‘they’ and ‘them’—part of a controversial psychosocial intervention often called ‘social transition,’” the complaint states. “Then, a school psychologist, who told school staff to keep their actions secret from Mrs. Vitsaxaki, began meeting with Jane regularly without Mrs. Vitsaxaki’s knowledge.” No one had told Jennifer Vitsaxaki that the district had made any of these decisions or taken these actions. “School staff carefully used Jane’s given name and female pronouns when speaking with Mrs. Vitsaxaki, and they repeatedly said everything was fine, all the while treating Jane as a boy and sending her resources for medical transition behind Mrs. Vitsaxaki’s back,” her lawsuit says. The district employees didn’t tell Vitsaxaki about any of this for months, the lawsuit alleges, and Jane’s mental condition worsened. She was resisting going to school and becoming increasingly anxious and negative. “At one point, and at her daughter’s request, Mrs. Vitsaxaki even took a job as a bus driver to learn more about what could be causing her daughter’s distress,” the suit says. Finally, a staff member “could no longer stomach” the deception and urged the principal to tell Jane’s mother. “When [the principal] finally did, Mrs. Vitsaxaki was shocked,” the complaint says. “She and her husband, Jane’s father, met with representatives of the school district. They directed the school district to stop taking any further action without their consent and sought open communication with the teachers to understand what had happened.” It continued: “But the principal told them school district policy required employees to deceive them, and despite assurances to the contrary, the deception continued. Left with no other options, Mrs. Vitsaxaki withdrew her daughter from the school district.” Vitsaxaki’s lawsuit stresses that she has a fundamental right to direct the upbringing, education, and health care of her child, a right that is “inconsistent with the deceptive, heavy-handed, and disruptive intervention that the school district perpetrated against Mrs. Vitsaxaki’s daughter—an intervention that gravely interfered with her ability to raise her daughter and contradicted her religious beliefs.” “Ultimately, parents—not school employees or other government officials—ought to decide how to resolve a child’s questions about sensitive topics like identity and gender confusion,” the complaint says. “Parents like Mrs. Vitsaxaki know their children better than anyone else. And parents, not school employees, will be there for a child in the long run, when the consequences of these decisions become fully apparent.” – – – Mary Margaret Olohan is a senior reporter for The Daily Signal.

(Skaneateles CSD)SKANEATELES, N.Y. (CITC) — A New York State school district is being sued for allegedly facilitating a student's gender transition without parental consent.Jennifer Vitsaxaki filed the lawsuit against the Skaneateles Central School District (Skaneateles CSD) Wednesday. The lawsuit claims district employees began ""socially transitioning"" Vitsaxaki's then-12-year-old daughter during the 2020-21 school year.Skaneateles CSD employees allegedly referred to Vitsaxaki's daughter using a name and pronouns which did not match her birth certificate. Vitsaxaki claims that during the same time, she noticed her daughter was ""struggling with anxiety and depression related to school,"" but school employees consistently assured her there was nothing to worry about.Months later, a Skaneateles CSD teacher allegedly ""urged the principal to come clean"" to Vitsaxaki. The mother was ""shocked"" and quickly withdrew her daughter from the school district, according to the lawsuit.The lawsuit claims Skaneateles CSD violated Vitsaxaki's constitutional right to ""direct the upbringing, education and healthcare of her children,"" as well as ""gravely interfered with her ability to raise her daughter and contradicted her religious beliefs.""READ MORE | Ohio school district requires staff to use students' preferred names, pronounsAlliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Kate Anderson, who is representing Vitsaxaki, told Crisis in the Classroom (CITC) parents cannot raise their children properly if they're being ""lied to.""School districts need to respect parental rights because they're important,"" Anderson told CITC. ""And it hurts kids when they can't have their parents involved to guide them and to give them the space to work through what they need to.""The lawsuit states a Skaneateles CSD policy allows the district to ""create or change unofficial records"" if a transgender or gender nonconforming student wishes to use an alternate name. Records containing the student's birth name and biological sex are allegedly then kept in ""a separate, confidential file.""""We're seeing more and more of these policies spreading across the country, where schools are, in their written policy even, saying that they will not notify parents,"" Anderson told CITC.

The guidance also notes that ""only the student knows whether it is safe to share their identity with caregivers.""A national poll conducted last year found that 74% of registered voters feel schools should not be able to help students ""change their gender identity"" without involving their parents.Have something for the Crisis in the Classroom team to investigate?

A New York woman is suing a local school district, alleging officials began treating her middle-school daughter as a boy without her knowledge or consent, and at the same time, hiding it from her. Attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a nonprofit religious rights law firm, are representing Jennifer Vitsaxaki. They filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday against the Skaneateles Central School District and the Skaneateles Central Schools' Board of Education for its employees' actions. According to the complaint, Vitsaxaki had contacted the school when her daughter began struggling with anxiety and depression. She repeatedly asked school employees if they had noticed anything troubling her daughter. She was repeatedly reassured her daughter was fine. However, while school officials kept telling Vitsaxaki that there was nothing to report, a school counselor was regularly meeting with her daughter and other girls who were the victims of ongoing bullying. The school district reportedly began treating Vitsaxaki's daughter as if she were a boy, without telling her mother, just as it had done with several other girls in her grade, according to the lawsuit. ***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news.*** ADF says the same counselor instructed school staff to treat Vitsaxaki's daughter as though she were a boy by referring to her with a boy's name and the third-person plural pronouns ""they"" and ""them."" Then, a school psychologist, who told school staff to keep their actions secret from the girl's mother, reportedly began meeting with her daughter regularly without her knowledge. Yet no one informed Mrs. Vitsaxaki that the School District had made any of these decisions and taken all of these actions toward her daughter, the complaint said. ""For months, School District employees concealed this information about the well-being of Mrs. Vitsaxaki's daughter—sensitive information about the girl's struggles with gender,"" the lawsuit said. ""Eventually, one staff member could no longer stomach the School District's deception of Mrs. Vitsaxaki and urged the principal to come clean,"" ADF attorneys wrote in the lawsuit. ""When he finally did, Mrs. Vitsaxaki was shocked. She and her husband, Jane's father, met with the School District. They directed the School District to stop taking any further action without their consent and sought open communication with the teachers to understand what had happened. But the principal told them School District policy required employees to deceive them, and despite assurances to the contrary, the deception continued."" By socially transitioning Mrs. Vitsaxaki's daughter without her consent and by concealing vital information about her daughter's health and well-being, the district violated Mrs. Vitsaxaki's fundamental parental rights and her deeply held religious beliefs, the ADF said. The nonprofit law firm noted the U.S. Constitution protects her right as a parent to make decisions about the upbringing, education, and health care of her children. ""Parents, not the government, have the right to direct the upbringing, education, and health care of their children,"" ADF Senior Counsel Kate Anderson, director of ADF's Center for Parental Rights, said in a statement. ""Parents should be able to drop their kids off at school without fear that school staff will conceal critical information or cut them out of weighty decisions with the potential for life-long impact on their kids."" ""The Skaneateles Central School District policy in this lawsuit betrays the trust of parents like Mrs. Vitsaxaki and violates their fundamental rights. Not only that, it violates Mrs. Vitsaxaki's right to exercise her Christian faith by raising her daughter consistent with her sincerely held religious beliefs about human nature, gender, and identity, among other topics,"" Anderson continued. ""Because school officials concealed their actions from Mrs. Vitsaxaki, they prevented her from helping her daughter at a time she needed her mother's loving guidance most. Schools shouldn't hide important information from parents like Mrs. Vitsaxaki,"" she added. ADF attorneys filed the lawsuit, Vitsaxaki v. Skaneateles Central School District, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, Syracuse Division. CBN News has reached out to District Superintendent Eric Knuth for comment.

Worse, although those employees knew about the School District's actions, they told Mrs. Vitsaxaki nothing,"" the complaint argued.""School staff carefully used Jane's given name and female pronouns when speaking with Mrs. Vitsaxaki, and they repeatedly said everything was fine, all the while treating Jane as a boy and sending her resources for medical transition behind Mrs. Vitsaxaki's back.""The lawsuit claims ""Jane"" continued to suffer from depression and anxiety during this time until her mother took her out of the public school and enrolled her in a private school in Syracuse, with her daughter's condition improving soon after.This improvement has included the daughter no longer wishing to identify as a boy or use plural pronouns and overall better mental health.The new school is 25 miles away from the Vitsaxaki home, according to the complaint, and currently costs $12,660 a year in tuition fees, with the lawsuit calling these ""the financial harms that the School District's actions caused to Mrs. Vitsaxaki.""Vitsaxaki is being represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group that has won multiple religious freedom cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.""Parents, not the government, have the right to direct the upbringing, education, and health care of their children,"" said ADF Senior Counsel Kate Anderson in a statement.""The Skaneateles Central School District policy in this lawsuit betrays the trust of parents like Mrs. Vitsaxaki and violates their fundamental rights. Not only that, it violates Mrs. Vitsaxaki's right to exercise her Christian faith by raising her daughter consistent with her sincerely held religious beliefs about human nature, gender, and identity, among other topics.""In July 2015, the New York State Education Department issued guidance regarding the creation of ""safe and supportive"" schools for ""transgender and gender nonconforming students.""""The person best situated to determine a student's gender identity is the individual student,"" claimed the guidance. ""In the case of very young students not yet able to advocate for themselves, the request to respect and affirm a student's identity will likely come from the student's parent or guardian.""The guidance notes that while school officials ""should work closely with the student and family"" regarding a ""transgender status,"" there are cases when ""students do not want their parents to know about their transgender status.""""These situations must be addressed on a case-by-case basis and will require schools to balance the goal of supporting the student with the requirement that parents be kept informed about their children,"" continued the 2015 document.""The paramount consideration in those situations is the health and safety of the student and making sure that the student's gender identity is affirmed in a manner in which the level of privacy and confidentiality is maintained necessary to protect the student's safety.""According to an updated guidance released last year, a student is ""not required to obtain parental/guardian consent or a court-ordered name and/or gender change before being addressed by their affirmed name and pronouns."" Also, the state instructs schools only to involve parents if ""given permission by the student.""Follow Michael Gryboski on Twitter or FacebookWas this article helpful?Yes12 VotesNoHelp keep The Christian Post free for everyone.By making a recurring donation or a one-time donation of any amount, you're helping to keep CP's articles free and accessible for everyone.$25/month$50/quarter$100/yearOne-timeNot this timeWe’re sorry to hear that.Hope you’ll give us another try and check out some other articles.

Represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, Jennifer Vitsaxaki of New York filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Skaneateles Central School District and Board of Education, accusing them of violating her constitutional rights through their deception and their social transitioning of her 12-year-old daughter, Jane. The Daily Signal first obtained the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. Skaneateles, New York, where the school district is located, is about 22 miles southwest of Syracuse. “Parents have the right to direct the upbringing and education of their kids, and they cannot fulfill those responsibilities when schools hide information from them and make critical decisions that can have lifelong consequences for their child,” said Kate Anderson, senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom. “So, this case is important to ensure that all parents can have the information they need to do what’s best for their kids.” Though Michael Vitsaxaki and Jennifer Vitsaxaki are both U.S. citizens, the Vitsaxaki family had spent almost a decade in Greece, where the Vitsaxaki parents were from, and Jane’s primary language was Greek. The family decided to leave Greece when its economy collapsed and they realized that they could not continue raising their children there, but the transition from their closely knit community in Greece to the U.S. was disruptive to the entire family’s lives. Young Jane Vitsaxaki had to adapt to a “new culture, including learning to go through each day speaking primarily English instead of Greek,” and her father’s job required him to frequently travel out of the country. The complaint states that Jennifer Vitsaxaki began to be increasingly concerned as her daughter was exhibiting signs of anxiety and depression and occasionally refusing to leave home. The mother repeatedly asked school district employees about whether they had noticed anything troubling her daughter, but was met with denials and assurances that her daughter was fine. “Those repeated reassurances concealed the truth,” the complaint states. “While school officials kept telling Mrs. Vitsaxaki that there was nothing to report, a school counselor was regularly meeting with her daughter and her peers to address ongoing bullying suffered by … Jane, and other girls in the group.” Worse than that, the complaint said, the district began treating Jane as though she were a boy—”just as it had done with several other girls in her grade.” 01_2024.01.31-VvSCSD-COMP-Plaintiffs-Verified-Complaint_TO-FILEDownload “The same counselor instructed school staff to treat Mrs. Vitsaxaki’s daughter as though she were a boy by referring to her with a boy’s name and the third-person plural pronouns ‘they’ and ‘them’—part of a controversial psychosocial intervention often called ‘social transition,'” the complaint states. “Then, a school psychologist, who told school staff to keep their actions secret from Mrs. Vitsaxaki, began meeting with Jane regularly without Mrs. Vitsaxaki’s knowledge.” No one had told Jennifer Vitsaxaki that the district had made any of these decisions or taken these actions. “School staff carefully used Jane’s given name and female pronouns when speaking with Mrs. Vitsaxaki, and they repeatedly said everything was fine, all the while treating Jane as a boy and sending her resources for medical transition behind Mrs. Vitsaxaki’s back,” her lawsuit says. The district employees didn’t tell Vitsaxaki about any of this for months, the lawsuit alleges, and Jane’s mental condition worsened. She was resisting going to school and becoming increasingly anxious and negative. “At one point, and at her daughter’s request, Mrs. Vitsaxaki even took a job as a bus driver to learn more about what could be causing her daughter’s distress,” the suit says. Finally, a staff member “could no longer stomach” the deception and urged the principal to tell Jane’s mother. “When [the principal] finally did, Mrs. Vitsaxaki was shocked,” the complaint says. “She and her husband, Jane’s father, met with representatives of the school district. They directed the school district to stop taking any further action without their consent and sought open communication with the teachers to understand what had happened.” It continued: “But the principal told them school district policy required employees to deceive them, and despite assurances to the contrary, the deception continued. Left with no other options, Mrs. Vitsaxaki withdrew her daughter from the school district.” Vitsaxaki’s lawsuit stresses that she has a fundamental right to direct the upbringing, education, and health care of her child, a right that is “inconsistent with the deceptive, heavy-handed, and disruptive intervention that the school district perpetrated against Mrs. Vitsaxaki’s daughter—an intervention that gravely interfered with her ability to raise her daughter and contradicted her religious beliefs.” “Ultimately, parents—not school employees or other government officials—ought to decide how to resolve a child’s questions about sensitive topics like identity and gender confusion,” the complaint says. “Parents like Mrs. Vitsaxaki know their children better than anyone else. And parents, not school employees, will be there for a child in the long run, when the consequences of these decisions become fully apparent.” Have an opinion about this article?

A former World Wrestling Entertainment superstar who once weighed a hulking 280 pounds soon might be paid to throw women around as a transgender wrestler. Thanks to surgeries and hormone therapy, Gabe Tuft — known as Tyler Reks in WWE before he left in 2012 — “transitioned” into Gabbi Tuft in 2021. Advertisement - story continues below He recently decided to re-enter the ring as a “woman” 10 years after retiring in 2014. This is a dodgy career move that was unheard of until a few years ago, when liberals and their corporate media lapdogs began rabidly promoting transgenderism.

We co-parent … Everything’s amazing now.” He told Fox News that his brother had committed suicide in 2012 following a crippling methamphetamine addiction.

I really couldn’t. And I still can’t. And it’s one of those soul-searching moments.” Watch the latest video at foxnews.com Shockingly, Tuft said he still doesn’t know why he wanted to kill himself or why he suddenly wanted to transition into a female.

Aside from the excruciating mental health issues inherent to transgenderism, the issue of allowing men to compete in women’s sports has ignited a volcanic backlash from critics who say it’s unfair. Advertisement - story continues below Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who’s a physician, has said the very idea is misogynistic and anti-science. Similarly, MMA commentator Joe Rogan has said allowing men to beat up women in contact sports is akin to sanctioned domestic violence. “We’re built different, and it’s just a fact. And anyone who tries to argue that is crazy,” he said in a 2018 podcast. WARNING: The following video contains vulgar language that some viewers may find offensive. Advertisement - story continues below Rogan, a self-proclaimed social liberal, said transgender athletes shouldn’t be allowed to fight women in combat sports because we need to “keep women from getting beaten up by men.” While pro wrestling is scripted entertainment rather than actual athletic competition, one wonders how female wrestlers would feel about being thrown around the ring by Gabbi Tuft.

No, former U.S. national security advisor Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn said that to the founder of The Western Journal, Floyd Brown. Gen. Flynn’s warning means that the 2024 election is the most important election for every single living American. If we lose this one to the wealthy elites who hate us, hate God, and hate what America stands for, we can only assume that 248 years of American history and the values we hold dear to our hearts may soon vanish. The end game is here, and as Benjamin Franklin said, “We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.” All of this means that without you, it’s over. We have the platform, the journalists, and the experience to fight back hard, but Big Tech is strangling us through advertising blacklists, shadow bans, and algorithms. Did you know that we’ve been blacklisted by 90% of advertisers? Without direct support from you, our readers, we can’t continue the fight. Can we count on your support?

""Some reporter asked me to do an interview on being dyslexic. Now, this is nine months after the games. I thought, ‘I would love to do that.’ Maybe it's going to help some young kids out, you know, because nobody talked about it before. ""And so I did this interview. And in today's terms, it went viral.""Jenner said that the interview was everywhere, and before you knew it dyslexia — which wasn't talked about previously — was everywhere.""Parents were going to their kids, and if they turn one word around, or they said something, (parents would say), 'Oh my God, my child's dyslexic. I have to get help. I have to do something about it.'""And I see schools for being dyslexic are opening up, psychologists or doing complete programs for dyslexic kids. And it gets out of hand."" Hmm… sound familiar?Jenner said that this led to her not wanting to talk about dyslexia anymore.""I got about three or four years into talking about it, to be honest with you, I stopped talking about it,"" Jenner explained. ""I said, 'Everybody's trying to make money off this thing.' You know, and it didn't have to be that way.""Caitlyn Jenner told OutKick's Riley Gaines about how interviews she gave on two entirely different subjects decades apart were both taken advantage of. (Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports)Jenner Saw The Same Thing Happen After Opening Up About Being TransgenderCaitlyn Jenner opened up about being transgender in a 2015 interview with Diane Sawyer.""My intentions when I transitioned was for me to live with myself,"" Jenner said. ""I couldn't do it privately. I had to do it publicly. I was in the public eye. I won the Games, I was on the most successful reality show in history, the list goes on and on and on.I'm in the public eye; unless I, like, move to Alaska, into the backwoods into a little house and I hid there. That's not gonna work. I've got family. I've got 10 kids, you know, 23 grandchildren now. I can't leave all of that.""Much like Jenner's interview about being dyslexic, her interview with Sawyer and news of her transition went viral in the most modern sense possible.""It just became a story that was everywhere. I mean, the cover of Vanity Fair started it,"" Jenner said.That cover shattered records on Twitter, but Jenner soon started noticing that the story was being co-opted.""I think in a lot of cases, I have been used by the media, by the left who's trying to push this,"" Jenner said. I have been used. ""So today it's the same thing. I feel the same way. Although, technically, I can't stop talking about it because there's a lot of things that have to be done. But I think society has to stop talking about it,"" she said.""This is a small, small, small group of people, but it's a big meaty issue, and it's not going anywhere.""Tags#Gaines For Girls#Caitlyn Jenner#riley gainesWritten by Matt ReigleMatt is a University of Central Florida graduate and a long-suffering Philadelphia Flyers fan living in Orlando, Florida.

Tamara Pietkze said she quit her job as a therapist of six years at MultiCare after her supervisors allegedly directed her to affirm patients expressing discomfort with their biological sex as the opposite gender, according to an article she penned, published by The Free Press.“In the last year, I noticed a concerning new trend in my field,” Pietkze wrote. “I was getting the message from my supervisors that when a young person I was seeing express discomfort with their gender — the diagnostic term is gender dysphoria — I should throw out all my training.” For six years therapist Tamara Pietzke worked at a hospital that declared all teens with gender dysphoria must be affirmed. She quit her job to blow the whistle. “We can no longer medicalize youth and cause them potentially irreversible harm.”https://t.co/zVuYCu8SCT — The Free Press (@TheFP) February 5, 2024 One patient Pietkze treated was diagnosed with gender dysphoria by a pediatrician after she attempted suicide following multiple alleged sexual assaults by a classmate, her cousin and one of her mother’s boyfriends. The former therapist said she “was scared” and that it felt like “malpractice” to consent to her patient receiving hormone therapy due to her “many overlapping problems.” The patient was allegedly transferred to a different therapist after Pietkze told a program manager about her concerns, Pietkze claimed. (RELATED: Drag Queen Principal Resigns From Oklahoma School Following Backlash: REPORT) Pietkze allegedly underwent mandatory training from the hospital on “gender-affirming care” before she quit her job. She claimed that she learned that it was “dangerous” for her career to question the ideology, alleging that she could only “silently nod along” when one patient told her she identified as a “wounded male dog.” “No matter the patient’s history or other month health conditions that could be complicating the situation, I was simply to affirm that the patient was transgender, and even approve of a medical transition,” Pietkze wrote.

Photograph: REX/ShutterstockAwards and prizesFlemish film awards under fire after men win most prestigious gender-neutral categoriesActors say non-specific categories benefit men as industry still offers them more interesting rolesAshifa Kassam and Jon HenleyMon 5 Feb 2024 10.26 ESTLast modified on Mon 5 Feb 2024 21.30 ESTThe Flemish film and television awards are facing calls to temporarily do away with gender-neutral categories amid concerns that the switch has left women routinely shut out of the top awards.At the Ensors awards on Saturday male actors cleaned up the categories for best lead and supporting actors. It was an echo of 2022 – the first year that the awards ceremony axed gendered categories – when men also walked away with each of the four awards recognising the best actors.The results prompted calls to temporarily revert back to the traditional format. “I think we should abolish it for a while and look for another way,” actor Aimé Claeys, who won best lead actor for the TV series 1985, told the Flemish public broadcaster VRT. “Because there are just as many women who deserve just as much to win such prizes. But it’s not working yet.”The debate has cropped up since award ceremonies around the world began scrapping gendered categories. Last year the Brit awards, which went gender neutral in 2021 after realising that the categories excluded non-binary people, faced a backlash after the nominees for best artists were all male.At Saturday’s Ensors awards, held in Ostend, Belgium, the actor Stef Aerts said he recognised that the switch had been made with “good intentions” but had perhaps come too soon because of the barriers that remain for women in the industry, such as the “very different roles” being written for men and women.Aerts said: “Once we’ve made that change, then maybe the awards can follow. But I think at the moment it’s just a bit too early.”As a result, the gender neutral awards end up “missing the mark” said Aerts, shortly after winning best supporting performance for the film Wil. “It’s nonsense that there are no women at the podium.”In the run-up to the awards, women had accounted for half of the nominees for the top acting categories, said Wim Vanseveren, the chair of the academy that represents professionals from the Flemish audiovisual sector. “We are very satisfied, although there could certainly have been more diversity in the result,” Vanseveren told VRT.About 55% of the members of the academy are male, he said, though he did not know the gender breakdown of the 600 or so members of the academy who had cast their vote for the awards. “And that does not mean that men necessarily voted for men or vice versa. We all want to look at that,” he said.He cautioned against drawing hasty conclusions over this year’s result. “It’s not necessarily the case that gender-neutral prizes always lead to something like this,” he said.Each year after the ceremony, the academy carries out a “thorough” evaluation, he said. “This year will be no different. We want to do this with an open mind and draw conclusions based on facts and figures.”It is not the first time the Ensors awards have come under fire over the decision to do away with gendered categories. Last year the actor Veerle Baetens of the Oscar-nominated The Broken Circle Breakdown, laid bare what she saw as the shortcomings of the decision in an interview with the film magazine Fade to Her.“Last year, we had the Flemish film awards and they wanted to make a gender neutral prize,” she said when asked for her thoughts on the situation of women in film today. “And so, we had four women and four men nominated, but all four men won because their characters are far more interesting, far more exotic to see.”She continued: “They have flaws, they can be dirty, they can be everything while women still can’t.”Explore more on these topicsAwards and prizesWomenBelgiumTelevisionEuropenewsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This week, the Campaign for Southern Equality, a LGBTQ advocacy organization, filed a federal Title IX complaint in response to the harmful effects that they say State Bill 49 and House Bill 574 are having on North Carolina students, especially those who are transgender and gender nonconforming.The 113-page complaint gathered testimonials from more than 20 students, parents, and school faculty. It alleged that public schools are “systematically marginalizing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students in violation of Title IX.”SB 49, also known as the “Parent’s Bill of Rights” or “Don’t Say Gay Bill,” was passed by the General Assembly in August 2023, overriding a veto from Governor Roy Cooper. HB 574, a law that prohibits trans girls and women from competing in female sports in public schools, was also passed through a similar veto override.SB 49 strengthens parental control and censures discussion around LGBTQ+ topics at public schools. Specifically, it requires parental approval for mental health counseling, mandates schools to notify a parent or guardian if their child changes their name or pronouns, and bans instruction on gender identity or sexuality in kindergarten through fourth grade.Schools across the state are approaching the law differentlyThe deadline for school districts to comply with SB49 was Jan. 1. Some districts, including Asheville City Schools and Buncombe County, have struggled with how to implement the law in a way that affirms LGBTQ+ students.Buncombe County Schools, the largest school system in Western North Carolina, approved implementation of the measure for its 45 schools at the Dec. 7 meeting.Its policy requires parental notification when a student changes their name or pronouns, but allows teachers to refer students to their principal first if they think the student isn’t safe at home.In the Triangle, the Chapel Hill-Carrboro school board voted to not require parental notification for pronoun changes or prohibit classroom discussion about gender identity, sexuality or sexual activity, as reported by the News & Observer.The Asheville City School Board still hasn’t agreed on how to interpret the law. In December, Board Chair George Sieburg told BPR that he believes the intent of the law is to “silence the voice of our students who are transgender or gender fluid,” and that he hopes the school board will be able to enact policies and procedures that “explicitly show we’re going to support our students through this.”Asheville City Schools has postponed a vote on the law several times in the past few months. It now plans to hear public comment on Feb. 5 and take a final vote on Feb. 12.The complaint alleges a ‘hostile educational environment’The complaint that Campaign for Southern Equality filed on Jan. 31 alleges that the state’s Board of Education and Department of Public Instruction are responsible for “barring LGBTQ-affirming content, outing transgender students, erecting barriers to LGBTQ students receiving needed health care at school.”These actions create a “hostile educational environment” and violate Title IX’s “obligations to provide every student with a safe and non-discriminatory environment,” the complaint alleged.The Department of Public Instruction did not respond for comment.Craig White, a spokesperson for the Campaign for Southern Equality, told BPR the complaint only “scratches the surface” of the SB49’s effects on students.“As we receive testimony and hear stories from all over the state, this situation is so much worse than what I expected,” White said.“[The complaint] doesn't get into the way that this legislation, which targets LGBTQ students, has really empowered both adults and students to be bullying queer and trans kids. And that's happening in school districts, whether they're progressive or conservative. We've heard lots of reports of bullying on the increase.”He continued, “And it's not surprising when the general assembly decides to target a specific group of people because of their identity that a lot of other bullies and bigots are going to follow their lead.”This is not the first time a local organization has filed a Title IX complaint in response to SB49. In December, three local LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations –Youth Outright, Campaign For Southern Equality, and PFLAG Asheville – filed a local Title IX complaint to the Buncombe County School Board.The board dismissed the complaint , citing lack of specificity. Buncombe’s Title IX coordinator Shanon Martin wrote the complaint must “specify an alleged perpetrator or victim of sexual harassment.”What’s next?The federal Office for Civil Rights and Department of Justice have a “pretty serious backlog,” according to White.“We don't know how long this process is going to take,” he said. “They will assign a federal civil rights investigator to look into our allegation. And if they find that there is in fact discrimination and a violation of Title IX, then they will work with the [Department of Public Instruction] and the [State Board of Education] to remedy the harm and to come back into compliance.” Tags News LGBTQ+ Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Laura Hackett Laura Hackett joined Blue Ridge Public Radio in June 2023.

Marie Toronto Vancouver Vancouver Island Windsor Winnipeg Search CTVNews.ca Search Edmonton 'We won't accept': Hundreds spend weekend protesting new UCP policies aimed at trans youth Share Hundreds of protesters gathered in Edmonton over the weekend to speak out against proposed legislation that would limit access to medical treatments for trans youth. LGBTQ2S+ community members, activists and their allies gathered Saturday and Sunday to decry the UCP's recently announced policies regarding gender in schools, sports and health care. At a Thursday press conference, Premier Danielle Smith said the rules are meant to protect trans and non-binary youth. Trans Rights Yeg, who organized a rally in Old Strathcona Saturday, said the rules will only hurt young trans and non-binary people. ""Hate is born in ignorance, and a governmental body is pushing a narrative that is misinformed, untrue and unjust,"" said Rowan Morris, of Trans Rights Yeg. ""It's hard enough to exist as a queer person, as a trans person in this world already, and I think that introducing legislation like this is really putting us backwards in terms of where we should be going,"" said protester Megan Bohach. If the legislation passes, schools would need to notify parents and get consent for students wanting to use a different name or pronoun, and trans girls and women would not be allowed to compete in sports against biologically female athletes. The policies would also limit how and when trans and non-binary youth can access gender-affirming medical care like puberty-blocking medication, hormone therapy or surgery. Zim Halldorson is 14 and identifies as non-binary. They said they're scared of what the new rules might mean for their own health-care journey. ""I want to be able to feel comfortable in my body,"" Halldorson said. ""Especially here in Alberta, it's not always the most welcoming place, so I was really hoping to get on some of the gender -affirming treatments so I can be able to feel more happy."" Smith said, under the new legislation, age limits on gender-affirming health care would exist even in cases where parents and medical professionals have agreed on the treatment plan. New legislation from the UCP would prevent young people from accessing gender-affirming puberty blockers, which the Canadian Pediatric Association considers a reversible and safe treatment for trans and non-binary youth. (Jeremy Thompson/CTV News Edmonton)Protester Liz Greenaway said Smith used ""fear based rhetoric"" when she announced the legislation. ""I just felt sick,"" she added. ""I have a trans kid, I would support them to the ends of the earth."" ""What the UCP is doing, and what [Smith's] doing … is making a marginalized group of people more vulnerable,"" Greenaway said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the province's new policies the ""most anti-LGBT of anywhere in the country."" Trans Rights Yeg believes the policies were created without consulting community members, teachers or trans youth. Premier Smith's office declined to comment on the protests Saturday and did not respond to questions over the consultation process for the new legislation. Instead, Smith's press secretary reiterated that the polices intend to ""preserve the choices children and youth have before potentially making life-altering and often irreversible adult decisions."" On Monday, at a press conference in Ottawa, she said: ""I think we have announced our intention on a number of policy items and we're going to be putting the architecture and legislation in place in the fall, so we've got lots of time for consultation and we'll be able to get that feedback. But there are things about the process that I do want to investigate just to make sure there is that level of rigour that has been recommended. You are supposed to have a long period of time of counselling and living in the opposite gender, or the gender of choice, and just from some of the stories I've heard, I just need to make sure that process is being followed. ""So there'll be a bunch of consultation in the next number of months."" 'We will continue fighting' A second protest was held at the Alberta Legislature Sunday. High School teacher Kevin McBean said it was encouraging to see hundreds of people show up for the second day of demonstrations. ""That gives me hope and optimism. I hope that the government's listening when we tell them that this is not okay for trans kids, that we won't accept the danger they're putting trans lives into,"" McBean said. Multiple medical professionals, including doctors who specialize in treating trans youth, have called the policies harmful and questioned the reasoning behind them. 'A direct attack': Alberta's trans health lead protests new guidelines Alberta doctors question science behind UCP's policies on health-care for trans youth ""It's devastating for the mental health of a young person who's struggling with this, for your identity – for your entire existence – to be questioned by every single person in the province,"" said Dr. Simone Lebeuf, an adolescent medicine pediatrician specializing in gender-affirming care, on Friday. ""I have so many patients who have been extensively bullied, harassed, who've been kicked out of their homes … because of their gender identity. And this is just going to escalate all of that."" Patrick Masse, a Canadian country music artist, was at Sunday's protest. He lost a trans friend to suicide. He believes the policies announced by Smith will lead to more deaths in the community. ""People have the right to be who and how they are,"" Masse said. ""[She] should not be speaking on these topics, because [she's] not an expert."" Protesters gathered for the second day Sunday, Feb. 4, to decry proposed legislation affecting trans and non-binary Albertans. (Brandon Lynch/CTV News Edmonton)Local politicians joined in protests Saturday and Sunday, encouraging demonstrators to voice their concerns to their local MLAs and MPs. ""We will continue fighting, but we need the tools,"" said NDP MLA Brooks Arcand-Paul Saturday. ""We need letters from you, we need petitions, we need things that we can introduce into the legislature so we can fight this."" Saturday, Alberta NDP leader Rachel Notley said the policies would take Alberta ""back 50 years."" Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault said Sunday that Smith's government should be focused on improving health care in her province and not ""going after a minority community."" ""The trans community, the queer community and our allies and champions are all standing up to say that Danielle Smith has got the wrong side of this,"" said Edmonton MP Randy Boissonnault Sunday. ""She's trying to insert herself between youth and their families, between people and their doctors."" Saturday, Smith's office confirmed the new legislation includes attracting more specialized medical professionals to Alberta and creating a private registry of doctors who specialize in trans health care. The party would also develop a ""counselling pilot project to help youth identifying as transgender and their families work through often difficult and complex issues and discussions."" Smith's office said some of the policies will be implemented through regulation and ministerial orders, while others may require legislation. ""In addition, some policy implementation will require consultation and feedback from various stakeholders,"" Smith's press secretary Sam Blackett said in a statement Sunday. ""The premier and cabinet will work together through this process with the goal of having these policies fully implemented by the end of the year.""

The rally was organized just days after Alberta Premier Danielle Smith proposed policy changes regarding transgender youth, gender-affirming care, sex education and parental notification.“I really don’t feel that our government has the right to impose the policy that they’re putting in for schools, safe spaces save lives and as far as I’m concerned that starts in our schools,” said Nancy Dodsworth, who attended the rally. “This sends a message that we’re here for you and there’s support for you.”“It’s really encouraging to see the turnout here, it gives me hope and optimism,” said Kevin McBean, a teacher at McNally High School in Edmonton. “I work with the (Gay-straight alliance) and a lot of trans kids. They’re really fearful about what’s coming with this, and they are scared about what it means for them, and the ability to be themselves.” Story continues below advertisement I hope the government is listening when we say this is not ok for trans kids.”Liberal MP and Edmonton Centre representative Randy Boissonnault addressed the crowd, offering his support.“I want to say to every transgender, questioning, gender diverse, queer person and their families and friends in this plaza who love them, we see you, we love you and we are there to defend and stand up with you,” Boissonnault said.

If you’re not able to support your child then you need to ask yourself why, not take it out on the school system or go to the government to impose that for you.”Last week, Smith said the government will require parental notification and consent if a child 15 years or younger changes their name and pronouns at school.She said parents of children aged 16 and 17 will not need to consent to the changes but will need to be notified.

Parents will also be given the choice to opt their children into classroom discussions and instruction on gender identity, sexual orientation or human sexuality. All third-party materials regarding these subjects must be pre-approved by the Ministry of Education. Story continues below advertisement The policy also prohibits anyone under 18 from getting gender affirmation surgeries. Puberty blockers and hormone therapy will not be allowed for kids 15 and under unless they’ve already started treatment.In a statement to Global News on Sunday, a spokesperson for the Alberta government said, “Some of the policies will be implemented through regulation and ministerial orders, while others may need legislation. In addition, some policy implementation will require consultation and feedback from various stakeholders. The Premier and cabinet will work together through this process with the goal of having these policies fully implemented by the end of the year.”More than 40 groups across Alberta demanded the province to halt the proposed policy changes in a joint statement issued on Saturday, saying the policy will disproportionately harm the transgender community.The statement, signed by 47 advocacy organizations and businesses across Alberta, called for an immediate halt to the policy. The groups also called on the province to consult with the transgender community and for the creation of new regulations based on established medical practices and evidence. Hundreds of people protested the proposed policy in Edmonton and Calgary on Saturday. 4:22 Protests against Alberta Premier Danielle Smith’s sweeping new transgender policy in Calgary, Edmonton “The premier did a very good job of striking a balance,” said David Oulton, television host on Out TV. “These are very complicated, nuanced topics. People were asking for policy and asking for some kind of regulation to be implemented- and so I think she’s managed to strike an appropriate balance.” Story continues below advertisement “I think the nice thing that will come out of the policy, especially around teachers having to inform and get consent around pronouns, I think the beautiful thing that will come out of this is that it will force the conversation,” Oulton continued. “It kind of makes sure that everyone in that child’s village, so to speak, is there to support them and is there to uplift them. The premier did a really good job in that seven-minute video of reiterating that you are loved, you are supported and we are here for you.”Tiffany Gillis, a transgender Calgarian, appeared on the Roy Green Show Sunday and said she supports the new policy and consulted with the premier on it.“We went through each line of the draft policy as it existed at the time, which was very similar to what was released last week, and just went over whether there were any potential issues or things that could have been worded better. I was generally supportive of all of it,” Gillis said.“I don’t think it’s playing politics. It’s a serious thing to go through. I struggled with gender dysphoria for a long time before I got help for it. But I know sometimes younger people aren’t sure of who they are going to end up becoming.“I’ve explained it a couple of times this way, if you could promise me that this 13-year-old who is identifying as trans will grow up to be a trans adult, then they would benefit from starting treatment earlier. The issue is that we really don’t know for sure who is going to persist in their trans identity into adulthood and there’s a lot of harm in treating people who turn out not to be trans and then de-transition later on and go to regret it later on.” Story continues below advertisement Gillis, who works in Alberta’s oil and gas sector, said the majority of Albertans she’s run into are supportive of trans people.“I’ve found that people are wholly supportive,” Gillis added. “Alberta and the oil industry are things that get a bad rap. I meet with a lot of people in the industry as part of my job. I travel to small towns around the province.

Protestors gather at the legislature during a rally for trans rights in Edmonton, Sunday, Feb. 4, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Amber Bracken EDMONTON — Groups opposed to Alberta's planned policies around transgender youth held rallies in Calgary and Edmonton over the weekend, with many of the attendees warning the plans will out trans kids and put their lives in jeopardy. Seventeen-year-old Jaidyn Wolf, who travelled from Red Deer to a rally at the provincial legislature in Edmonton on Sunday, said he's had trans friends die by suicide and he wants to speak out for other trans youth who don't have support at home. ""I started advocating at my school and it took getting the cops involved to stop the harassment that was caused by me and my friends being outwardly trans and gay at our school,"" Wolf said. The new rules proposed by the province's United Conservative government include restrictions on youth changing their names or pronouns at school and getting hormone therapy or gender reassignment surgery. Premier Danielle Smith has said the changes are to protect children from the consequences of choices they may later regret, and are also to preserve the role of parents. At a rally outside Calgary's city hall on Saturday, former mayor Naheed Nenshi called the video message in which Smith announced the moves ""cruelty,"" ""inhumane"" and ""un-Albertan."" Nenshi told the crowd that he'd reassured a high school student last year that they were safe living in Alberta, but he doesn't feel that way after hearing Smith's policy announcement. Now he said he hates that he was wrong. ""Premier Smith, I want you to understand that votes aren't worth a few dead kids,"" Nenshi said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau criticized the proposed policies last week as well, calling them the ""most anti-LGBT of anywhere in the country."" Smith has said the fall sitting of the legislature would bring a ban on gender reassignment surgery for those 17 and under. There would be no puberty blockers or hormone therapies for the purposes of such surgery for anyone 15 and under, unless they’ve already begun such procedures. Parental consent would be required for students 15 and under who want to change their names or pronouns at school. Students 16 and 17 would not need consent, but their parents would have to be notified. And the province would clamp down on transgender female athletes competing in women's and girls' sports. Carrie Townsend, who identifies as a ""non-binary transgender"" person, attended the Edmonton rally Sunday and said the policy announcement triggered feelings of grief and anger. Townsend, who grew up in Spruce Grove, west of Edmonton, said being a trans kid in the 1990s meant facing homophobia and queer phobia that they don't want kids to have to face anymore. ""I remember the silence around trans identity and queer identity, and I am here hopefully to fight so other children don't have to go through the same,"" Townsend said. New Brunswick and Saskatchewan have also enacted policies for young people questioning their gender, bringing in rules that require students 16 and younger to have parental permission to change their names or pronouns at school. Alberta says the current required age for genital reconstruction surgery is 18 and the required age for surgery on masculinization of the torso is 16. A court challenge in Alberta has already been promised by two LGBTQ rights advocacy groups. Smith has not ruled out using the notwithstanding clause in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to uphold the plans. Smith has also said parents would have to be notified and give consent for their children to be taught about gender identity, human sexuality and sexual orientation. Third-party resource materials used to teach these subjects from kindergarten through Grade 12 would have to be approved by the Education Ministry Many people at the rallies on the weekend referred to Smith by her first name, Marlaina, instead of Danielle, which is her middle name. Chris Hepburn, who is trans-masculine and attended the Edmonton rally, argued it's hypocritical of Smith to choose her name while denying trans kids the same opportunity. ""This legislation is literally going to cause children to die,"" Hepburn said. ""My life was really hard. I would have given my left arm for these therapies like puberty blockers and things like that, that kids now should have access to. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 4, 2024.

Opinions expressed are solely those of the author(s).HomeOpinionWhen the government comes for your children By Michael Brown, Op-ed Contributor Monday, February 05, 2024Getty Images It’s one of the ultimate nightmares. You find yourself living under a totalitarian regime which is militantly opposed to your personal beliefs and convictions. But you refuse to yield or cave in. To compromise is to lose your very soul. So, the government fights back. “Go ahead,” the authorities say, “and be a hero. But it will cost you dearly. We are taking away your children.”As a reader, your first thought might be, “Thank God we live in America.”Well, think again.What I described has now taken place right here in the USA, the land of the free and the home of the brave.Of course, things like this have happened under communism for years, where the state removes children from Christian homes and puts them in government schools to be indoctrinated and brainwashed.A 2009 report on a homeschooling website stated that “The plight of German homeschoolers may have gotten worse. Despite rules regarding the freedom of movement in the European Union, German government officials appear to have taken an unprecedented step of persuading French authorities to take four children from a family who fled Germany to France in order to escape persecution aimed at homeschoolers.”The headline itself was chilling: “German Homeschooled Children Seized by French Social Workers.”A few years ago, a distraught mother living in a “progressive” country outside the US told me her own horror story.Her 16-year-old daughter had begun to identify as transgender, quite out of the blue, and without the parents’ knowledge, the school informed her that if her parents were not supportive, the daughter could be removed from their home and raised in an affirming environment.This mom and dad were shocked beyond words when they learned this from school authorities. Who on earth gave them that right?But what about here in America, where homeschooling is widely practiced, where there is not a totalitarian communist regime, and where there is less infringement on our private lives? When is the government actually taking away anyone’s children, other than because of cases involving the real endangerment of the child?Back in 2022, the Washington Examiner shared the heartbreaking story of Abby Martinez, “who tried to fight back when a Los Angeles school, county social workers, and an LGBT group sought to transition her confused 15-year-old daughter.“But once Yaeli Martinez was moved into foster care and later injected with testosterone, the heartbroken mother could only watch helplessly as the girl spiraled into depression that ended when she stepped in front of an oncoming train.“‘They killed my daughter,’ a tearful Martinez told the Washington Examiner. ‘They had to pick pieces of her off of the track.’”You might say, “But there were other factors involved in that story, and the government was looking out for the child’s best interest.”The grieving mother would beg to differ, with every fiber of her being. And again, who empowered the state to make these kinds of decisions?That’s why there’s such grave concern over a growing number of states — 11 as of June 2023 — declaring themselves sanctuary states for trans-identified minors.“Come here,” they proclaim, “and get the medical care that you need, the care that all those states that are withholding from you. We’ll help you here, even without your parents’ consent.”And what happens to a trans-identified minor child who makes his or her way to one of these sanctuary states seeking trans-related care, against their parents’ wishes? Does the sanctuary state now have legal authority over that child? Do the parents have a way to get their child back?These are some of the very real, contemporary legal debates.But rather than speculate, we can ask a couple in Montana what happened to their daughter.As reported in the New York Post, “The parents told Reduxx that their issues with the state agency started when officials received a call in August 2023 that Jennifer, whose name was changed for publication at their request, expressed suicidal thoughts at school.“A CFS caseworker came to speak with the teen and inspect the house where Jennifer claimed she drank toilet bowl cleaner and took painkillers in an attempt to take her own life, the outlet reported.“The teen reportedly showed no related symptoms, and a test at the hospital showed she didn’t consume any toxins.“But her hospital stay stretched to multiple days, in which staff there noted that Jennifer identified as male and wanted to be called Leo. The parents said they quickly but unsuccessfully objected.“‘We were very clear to the emergency room staff as well as [CFS] that this goes against our values, morals and our religious beliefs,’ Krista Kolstad recalled to Reduxx, accusing the hospital of consistently undermining her and her husband’s authority.”And what happened next?“Jennifer was eventually moved to a specialized residential care facility in Wyoming despite her parents’ concerns. Kolstad told Reduxx she and Todd were worried about Jennifer being cared for in the state, where minors can receive gender-affirming care without parental consent.“‘They showed up at our home to serve us with papers to take Jennifer out of our care,’ Kolstad alleged. ‘They told me the reason was that we were “unable or refusing to provide medical care.” That’s just not true.’“Jennifer returned in September to a Montana youth facility, where she remains. Earlier this month, a court put the teen in the custody of CFS, Reduxx reported.”Need I say more, other than that we’ve been warning you that these days would come?Do you believe me now?Dr. Michael Brown (https://thelineoffire.org/) is the host of the nationally syndicated The Line of Fire radio show.

(Richard Moore/The Epoch Times) By Jackson Elliott2/4/2024Updated: 2/4/2024PrintA bill that would have allowed people to take children from parents to get transgender procedures in Maine was killed in committee.On Jan. 25, Maine’s House judiciary committee unanimously voted down the bill, with one member absent.This unanimous vote likely indicates Democrats weren’t willing to debate the bill in the House, Maine state Rep. Katrina Smith, a Republican, told The Epoch Times.“If it was a divided report, then there could be a chance,” Ms. Smith said. “They’ve done this a lot to us.”“The bill was 100 percent, maybe I'll say 99 percent, killed because of the public outcry,” Ms. Smith said. “We got an incredible amount of media attention.”In an election year, people notice bills like this one and their likely consequences, and the politicians who supported it may face consequences in November, Ms. Smith said.Related StoriesMaine’s Transgender Curriculum As Seen Through the Eyes of a Child and Her Family9/13/2022Maine Bill Would Take Children From Parents Who Refuse ‘Gender-Affirming Care’1/22/2024Maine state Rep. Katrina Smith (R). (Courtesy of Katrina Smith)She expects Democrats will continue to introduce similar bills, “if they’re in the majority.”“If they’re in the minority, it will have no chance and will be crushed,” she said. However, Democrats currently control Maine’s state house, state senate, and governor’s office.Ms. Smith said the bill would have violated parental rights, increased the number of child gender transitions, and likely have resulted in a flood of lawsuits from parents whose children were taken away to Maine for child gender transition.It is almost certain Democratic Maine legislators will brave those hazards at a later date, she said.Many Maine Democrats see allowing child gender transition as a moral issue on par with ending segregation, Ms. Smith said.“They certainly do believe that,” she said.The Epoch Times contacted the bill’s sponsor, state Rep. Laurie Osher, a Democrat, but received no comment by publication time.Ms. Osher provided written testimony supporting the bill, in which she says there’s “a coordinated national attack on gender-affirming care.”“For transgender and non-binary young people, the most important thing the adults in their lives can do is to be supportive,” Ms. Osher said, advocating for parents to support medical and surgical interventions in their children.Maine MotherAlicia Lawson, a Maine mother whose daughter briefly identified as transgender. (Courtesy of Alicia Lawson)The bill would have allowed Maine to take transgender-identifying children from parents within the state.It also allowed anyone to take a child from a state that banned child gender transition medical procedures into Maine. Maine wouldn’t consider this action to be child kidnapping under the bill.Maine mother Alicia Lawson believes the state would have been able to take Ms. Lawson’s child from her under the proposed bill.She said the pediatrician could have called up the Department of Health and Human Services and said, “'This mom is not allowing her child to have this care that she needs.”In 2020, Ms. Lawson’s teenage daughter identified as transgender.“She wanted to get on hormones,” Ms. Lawson told The Epoch Times. “While she wanted top surgery, she didn’t want bottom surgery.”She talked extensively with her daughter about the transgender feelings, and in a few years, her child grew out of them, Ms. Lawson said.These feelings were complicated because her daughter is autistic, she said.To navigate this topic, Ms. Lawson took her daughter to a pediatrician, who said signing her daughter up for gender transition surgery now would help her get through the long wait list for the procedure.“By the time she’s 18 to make her own choice, then she won’t have to wait on the waitlist,” the pediatrician said. Ms. Lawson said she refused this offer.Today, her daughter no longer wonders if she is a man, Ms. Lawson said.Transgender IndustryThere are also major financial reasons for Democrats to support bills that would allow gender transition surgeries on children in Maine, according to Heather Sprague, a Maine conservative activist.“I believe the bottom line is the money,” she said. “They profit off the money from these surgeries.”Heather Sprague, a Maine conservative activist. (Courtesy of Heather Sprague)Groups such as Planned Parenthood support and provide transgender procedures and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, supports many Democrat campaigns nationwide.Maine Health, a not-for-profit integrated group of hospitals and health services, supports child gender transition, according to its website.“The Gender Clinic is dedicated to supporting the health and well-being of transgender, gender diverse, and questioning people across Northern New England,” the group’s online page on transgender services states. “We offer treatment to patients of all ages with both pediatric and adult services.”Some of Maine Health’s medical treatments include puberty blockers, cross-sex hormone use, and surgery to make people appear like the opposite sex.Many transgender surgeries are expensive. Transgender breast amputation or creation surgery costs between $10,000 and $20,000. Genital transgender surgery can cost up to $150,000. Costs vary widely for facial feminization or masculinization surgery. Cross-sex hormones can cost between $30 to $100 per month.

Marie Toronto Vancouver Vancouver Island Windsor Winnipeg Search CTVNews.ca Search Calgary Hundreds of Albertans protest ‘uninformed’ provincial gender policies Share Hundreds of Albertans took to the streets in Calgary and Edmonton Saturday to show their support for the transgender community. The massive protests come days after controversial provincial policies were unveiled that will limit access to medical treatments for trans youth. LGBTQ2S+ community members, activists and their allies gathered to demand the UCP government roll back those legislation proposals that deal with gender in schools, sports and health care. “You just hope the (government) is actually listening,” Calgary protester Alyssa Quinney said. “We would all rather be anywhere else, but here we are.” At a Thursday press conference, Premier Danielle Smith said the rules are meant to protect trans youth and offer their parents more peace of mind. But her announcement has been met with swift opposition across the country — specifically from people arguing the proposals are going to have the exact opposite effect. Many in Calgary call the move political posturing meant for the fringes of Smith’s base. “‘Parental rights’ is a big blanket umbrella term being used to get people fired up about a non-issue,” parent Victoria Desjardins told CTV News. “It speaks to the fact that the UCP doesn’t know what the majority of Albertans want,” Leah Zurbrigg added. Roughly 1,200 people gathered in Calgary, including representatives from city council, the Alberta NDP, the Alberta Teachers’ Association and more. Cardinal policies So just how did we get here? On Thursday, Smith said she had help in creating the new proposals. “I've been very influenced over many years talking to many individuals in the transgender community,” she said. “I met with Lois Cardinal, who, as you may know, has felt that she was rushed into bottom surgery and is having consequences of that.” CTV News caught up with Cardinal this weekend. She says she came out and began transitioning at 19-years-old. Two years later — at 21 — she was approved for surgery and flown to Montreal. She says she felt “pushed through” the system and is angry doctors didn’t stop her. Cardinal now refers to herself as being “sterilized.” “I had several complications with vaginoplasty and also with a neurological condition,” she said. “I was at a breaking point.” Cardinal has met with Smith and been mentioned by the premier multiple times. She’s on board with the proposed changes. “What we are giving (kids) is time,” she said. “There’s no rush. “It’s such a personal experience, and I think loving parents and guardians should be involved.” At least partially inspired by Cardinal, Smith says she wants to make sure the post-op experience is improved. That’s especially where Cardinal says she felt let-down once she returned home. “We want to attract somebody into our province who can do the surgeries here,” Smith said Thursday. “So the aftercare can be done here.” Not the same? CTV News asked multiple protestors on Saturday about Cardinal’s impact on the premier. Jake Donaldson, who is a family physician, says he feels for the Saddle Lake resident. “Unfortunately, regret is just a reality of life,” Donaldson said. “What we’re weighing is the risk of regret for these young individuals versus the risk of doing nothing and forcing them through a puberty that doesn’t match their gender identity.” And there are multiple marked differences between Cardinal’s story and the story of those who will be impacted by what Smith has brought forward. Firstly, Cardinal was 21 when she transitioned: no longer a child who needed parental supervision. And though she feels rushed, many younger teens in the gender affirming process have even longer than two years to figure out what they want. Alberta’s current system has a lengthy waitlist and backlog, and surgeries are reserved for adults only. Lastly, the data suggests Cardinal is an outlier. Multiple North American studies — including a report out of Princeton University in 2022 — show the overwhelming majority of those young people who transition stick with it. Donaldson says it‘s unfair to colour the policy with one case. “People regret having kids,” he said. “And getting tattoos. We’re not going to ban those.” Smith is expected to turn the proposals into legislation this autumn.

(Helen Pike/CBC)Social SharingProtesters gathered in both Calgary and Edmonton Saturday to support the province's transgender community and express their dissatisfaction with new measures proposed by Premier Danielle Smith related to the province's student gender identity, sports and surgery policies. In Edmonton, hundreds of activists, allies and members of the transgender community gathered at Dr. Wilbert McIntyre Park in Old Strathcona.In Calgary, more than a thousand people attended the protest in front of city hall.Rowan Morris, who is with Trans Rights YEG — one of the groups behind the Edmonton rally, said the proposed policies are not only harmful to trans youth, but to the entire trans community in Alberta. ""Knowing that there's youth who are going to be growing up in an environment where they're not safe, and knowing the statistics behind gender-affirming care, we're here today because what is happening is absolutely not OK,"" said Morris. Morris, who uses the pronouns he/him and they/them, said the Alberta he fell in love with when he moved to the province in 2015 has changed. 'A complete stifling of who we are'In Edmonton, allies of the transgender community rallied in Dr. Wilbert McIntyre Park in Old Strathcona. Another protest is planned for Sunday. (Charles Delisle/Radio-Canada)""I felt like I came to my first day of high school and it was fine being new because everyone had been new before, everyone had been different before,"" Morris said.""But I don't feel that anymore in Alberta today. I don't feel this welcoming for people who are different. I don't feel this appreciation for individuality. What I'm feeling right now is a complete rollback on trans and queer rights, and a complete stifling of who we are as people.""Eddie Punko, who attended the rally in Edmonton, said he was devastated after hearing about the proposed policies. ""There's so many kids I work with [who] are so excited to explore their identity and grow up. But these kinds of policies make it really hard to think about even growing up and becoming an adult when it's so hard to just exist as a person.""Punko added that part of the reason he attended the rally was to spread joy amid uncertainty. ""Whatever policies get put in place [that say] you don't deserve to be safe, we're all here to say that you do and that we love you so much,"" he said, addressing the transgender community.James Demers, a transgender man and organizer of the rally in Calgary with the group Queer Citizens United, said the demonstration was about creating a show of solidarity with those who oppose the proposed policies.WATCH | Protesters voice opposition to Alberta's gender-identity policies: Hundreds protest Alberta’s new gender-identity policies12 days agoDuration 2:09Hundreds of people gathered outside Alberta's legislature to push back against recently announced plans to make sweeping changes to some of the province's policies around transgender youth.""Rather than protesting a specific action, this is about creating a demonstration of love for the community, so that the sense of isolation and loneliness which is trying to be accomplished through this legislation is combated,"" said Demers.""It's extremely draconian legislation, even in the context of other provinces who have attempted to similarly discriminate against gender-diverse people. Is the queer community surprised that the UCP [government] is attacking us through legislation? Not even remotely.… [The UCP] will not and have not made any effort to change.""AnalysisDanielle Smith bids to transcend politics with Canada's toughest trans youth rulesDoctors, nurses and medical groups urge province to walk back plans to limit gender-affirming careLeah Zurbrigg said it was important to her to attend the rally in Calgary to share her support of transgender youth and adults alike. ""It's really crazy important that we stand up and get this fixed, because this is not something that we can let stand,"" said Zurbrigg.""I have a lot of trans friends who I value very deeply and I know people who are in dangerous situations at home, and the fact that they could be outed puts them and their lives at risk. So I can't just sit and watch.""James Demers at the protest in Calgary in front of city hall. More than a thousand people attended. (Helen Pike/CBC)A small number of representatives from the group 1 Million March 4 Children, which opposes gender identity education in schools, was also present in Calgary to demonstrate support for the premier's proposed policies.Athletes, advocates push back against Alberta's new transgender policiesOn Thursday, Smith said her government will introduce legislation this fall to support the planned policy changes affecting transgender and non-binary youth and adults.The measures being proposed are: Top and bottom surgeries will be banned for minors aged 17 and under. Doctors say bottom surgeries aren't performed on youth and top surgeries are rare. Puberty blockers and hormone therapies for gender affirmation will not be permitted for children aged 15 and under. Youths aged 16 and 17 will be permitted to start hormone therapies for gender affirmation ""as long as they are deemed mature enough"" and have parental, physician and psychologist approval. Parental notification and consent will be required for a school to alter the name or pronouns of any child aged 15 and under. Students who are 16 or 17 won't need permission but schools will need to let their parents know first. Parents will have to ""opt-in"" their children every time a teacher plans to teach about gender identity, sexual orientation or sexuality. Alberta law currently requires parental notification and gives them the option to opt students out. All third-party teaching materials on gender identity, sexual orientation or sexuality will need to be approved in advance by the education ministry. Transgender women will be banned from competing in women's sports leagues. Smith said the government will work with leagues to set up co-ed or gender-neutral divisions for sports.

The statement, signed by 47 advocacy organizations and businesses across Alberta, called for an immediate halt to the policy. The groups also called on the province to consult with the transgender community and for the creation of new regulations based on established medical practices and evidence.“The Premier’s suite of measures seeking to restrict healthcare for transgender children, disclose private information regarding their gender identity without their consent & segregate transgender women from participation in sports do not reflect the values of our community,” the statement read.“Any proposal regarding the health and welfare of transgender children needs to include expert medical advice, and involve consultation with all concerned parties; teachers, social workers, families, legal professionals, and most importantly the transgender community. Story continues below advertisement “Instead, the UCP’s proposal interferes with Canadians’ protected charter rights and runs contrary to the evidence-based medical practices and research over the past 80 years. If implemented, this suite of measures risks placing trans youth who have unsupportive families in harmful situations, segregates trans women from participation in social activities, and limits access to resources for trans youth, even with parental consent.”Joint Statement Regarding @Alberta_UCP Policies Voncerning Trans Youth & Hender Affirming Care.As citizens of Alberta, we condemn the recent proposals by Premier Danielle Smith seeking to limit transgender healthcare and participation in society. 1/🧵 pic.twitter.com/YvbZUzIfEK— QCU.yyc (@QCUyyc) February 3, 2024This comes after Alberta Premier Danielle Smith published a video on social media Wednesday saying the government will require parental notification and consent if a child 15 years or younger changes their name and pronouns at school.In the video on X, formerly known as Twitter, Smith said parents of children aged 16 and 17 will not need to consent to the changes but will need to be notified.

While she said Saturday that the UCP “consulted very broadly” on this issue, she has not said who or what groups or experts were consulted.“We just think that’s the responsible way of approaching this issue so that kids are not precluded from all the future choices that come to them when they decide to make the decision that’s going to have potentially serious ramifications on their reproductive (health),” Smith told reporters on Thursday.

Hundreds attended the rally in Edmonton, while thousands attended the rally in Calgary.“These policies that have been released by the (United Conservative) cabinet are not in line with the beliefs of modern society and not Albertans in general,” said Victoria Bucholtz, a community organizer with Queer Citizens United.Bucholtz said she is happy to see a people coming to the rally, and said this is proof that Albertans are willing to rally to protect LGBTQ2 rights.Although the policy was “somewhat expected,” she told Global News the policy still shocked her. Story continues below advertisement “This is a test. This is a test of the progress, this is a test of the tolerance of our society. We haven’t stepped back, but we could,” Bucholtz said. “This is where we need to band together and examine our morals.”Rowan Morris, primary organizer with Trans Rights YEG, said he felt helpless and scared when Smith announced the policy on social media. He called the policy “transphobic,” and decided to organize the rally in Edmonton on Saturday.The rally is supporting all trans people in Alberta, he said. 1:44 Alberta policies on trans youth most anti-LGBTQ in Canada: Trudeau Trending Now Donald Trump, sons, businesses fined US$364M in NY civil fraud case A woman dying of cancer, and the struggle to get treatment to reduce her pain “The community is feeling attacked because their medical rights are being threatened. Their rights to simply existing (and) existing happily … Especially for youth,” Morris told Global News. “Many youth, not only trans youth, use different names in schools. It’s not specifically a trans issue.” Story continues below advertisement In a response to the rallies, the premier’s office maintained the policies were made to “preserve the choices children and youth have before potentially making life-altering and often irreversible adult decisions.”“To reaffirm our support for the transgender community, we are also providing additional supports to assist transgender adults to secure the health care they need like bringing medical professionals who specialize in transgender care to Alberta,” said Sam Blackett, press secretary to the Office of the Premier, in an emailed statement on Saturday afternoon.“We’re also developing a private registry of medical professionals who specialize in this field to make it easier for transgender Albertans to access needed medical treatment and care. Additionally, we’re developing a counselling pilot project to help youth identifying as transgender and their families work through often difficult and complex issues and discussions.”But Morris said the policies as a whole will exacerbate mental and physical health issues for many trans youth across the province.A study published by Duke University in 2022 surveyed more than 58,000 trans and non-binary people, 2 million cisgender women and 2 million cisgender men and found trans people had significantly higher rates of mortality at nearly every age compared to their cisgender counterparts.Morris said the disparity in mortality rates is because of policies similar to Alberta’s. Story continues below advertisement “It’s going to exacerbate violence against trans individuals,” he said. “All of these policy reveals are going to be a domino effect that will result in trans youth dying.”Noah, who attended the rally in Edmonton, said he wants to see trans youth live happy and healthy lives. He accused the provincial government of distracting Albertans from “real issues” like the housing crisis and the health-care crisis.“They’re a distraction of the real issues that we have going on. They’re trying to incite hatred in people, they’re trying to lie to everybody,” he told Global News. “It’s trying to pit people against each other … Love your kids for who they are, not who you think they should be.”–With files from Emily Mertz, Global News. 4:59 Alberta proposes policy changes affecting trans-gender youth Alberta proposes policy changes affecting trans-gender youth Alberta transgender female sport policy raises questions Concerns valuable opportunities for transgender athletes will be lost under Alberta policies Health Matters: Doctors criticize Alberta school policy targeting transgender youth Calgary sexual health doctor reacts to Alberta gender identity policy Previous Video Next Video Journalistic standards Comment Report an error © 2024 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Henna Saeed reports. By Henna Saeed Posted Feb 3, 2024 11:21:15 AM. Last Updated Feb 3, 2024 11:24:41 AM. Amid the criticism of Alberta’s proposed gender identity policies, a transgender woman who is a also parent of two, says the new rules have the right intention and direction. The Alberta government says changes to the legislation surrounding trans youth and gender identity will come in the fall. Tiffany Gillis was one of those consulted by Premier Danielle Smith in November 2023 during the drafting stage of the policies. “I think a lot of people don’t trust the motivation of it you know personally I do believe it is about protecting kids,” she told CityNews. “It’s a data draft at that time, which was largely similar to what was released. We just met at her office and we went through kind of each point on the list and what their rationalizations were and the opportunity to give my feedback as well.” Watch: Alberta announces slew of gender identity policies Gillis feels parental consent needed to change names and pronouns at school for kids under 15 is a much needed part of the new policy. “The things about notification and consent for changes in school, you know, I’m 100 per cent supportive of,” she said. “As a parent, I want to know what my kids are doing so that I can support them.” Related Stories: Alberta to require parental consent for name, pronoun changes at school ‘Demoralizing’ and ‘draconian:’ reactions pour in over Alberta’s new transgender policies Alberta’s proposed gender identity changes will affect 2SLGBTQ+ lives: experts As for limiting the age for top and bottom gender reassignment surgeries to over 17 and puberty blockers and hormone therapy for over 15, Gillis says this is the tougher part of the policies. “I also personally know the stories of a couple of people that transitioned young and … felt as though … they didn’t get proper psychological care before that and they weren’t ready to make that decision, and they’ve come to regret it later in life,” she said. “So … I think there’s harm also in treating earlier.” Gillis believes there might be room for more constructive discussion around the proposal but the rules are on point.

The policy will unravel former Education Secretary Betsy Devos’ Title IX rule, which ordered schools to conduct cross-examination during sexual misconduct investigations and conduct live hearings of them, according to Politico. Democrats and civil rights groups have been pressuring the Department of Education (ED) to finalize the rule, which would codify protections for “gender identity.” (RELATED: Elite University Donor Pledges To Pull Funding, Calls On President To Resign Over Diversity, Equity And Inclusion)“The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring all students are guaranteed an educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex,” an ED spokesperson told Politico. “The Department of Education has taken the next step to advance a rule, first proposed in 2022, that strengthens protections for students from sexual harassment and for LGBTQI+ students.” US Education Secretary Miguel Cardona speaks during a back-to-school K-12 Cybersecurity Summit in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on August 8, 2023. (Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP) Experts previously said that the move to rewrite Title IX by the Biden administration imperils women’s sports and weakens due process rights. The rules would require faculty to report improper use of a “transgender” person’s “pronouns” to the campus Title IX coordinator, Bob Eitel, Defense of Freedom Institute co-founder who helped DeVos create the Trump administration’s Title IX policy, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “So for instance if you have a biology teacher who has a transgender students who identifies as female but is biologically male, and there is a teacher’s aide in the classroom and that biology teacher refers to the male student who identifies as a female as ‘Mr. So and So,’ the teacher’s aid who observes that would be obligated as a matter of law under the standards proposed by the Biden administration to report that incident to the Title IX coordinator,” Eitel told the DCNF. The ED also has a separate deadline of March 2024 for a section regarding athletic eligibility that proposed outlawing transgender students’ sports participation bans, according to Politico. “The Department is still reviewing a second rule related to athletics, which was first proposed nine months after the first rule, and which received 150,000 public comments which by law must be carefully considered,” the department spokesperson said, according to Politico.

(Jon Cherry/Getty Images)By Melanie Sun2/3/2024Updated: 2/4/2024PrintThe Biden administration’s Department of Education has submitted its proposed Title IX reforms to the White House for approval, ahead of a pending March deadline for the long-awaited rules promised during President Joe Biden’s 2020 election campaign.The proposed changes to Title IX, the federal civil rights law prohibiting sex-based discrimination at federally-funded schools, are expected to outline how schools are to respond to sexual abuse and misconduct, as well as how the Biden administration will approach protections for students who identify as a gender that is different to their sex and their access to women’s sports.Then-candidate Joe Biden promised his supporters that he would quickly alter the Trump administration’s Title IX regulations if he was elected to the White House.On Friday, the department announced that it had sent its proposals for Title IX laws to the Office of Management and Budget for review.If approved by the president’s budget office, the reforms will see an expansion to former Education Secretary Betsy Devos’s definition of sexual misconduct. Ms. Devos also made sure schools performed live hearings during investigations into sexual misconduct or discrimination.The announcement is a welcome and long-awaited step toward President Biden’s America.Related StoriesComplaint Filed Against 3 Airline Companies for ‘Illegal Racial and Sex Discrimination’1/18/2024Trump Promises to End Tax Favors for Colleges That Discriminate Against Conservatives and Promote Anti-Semitism12/18/2023LGBT students and student survivors of sexual assault have been urging the Biden administration to quickly act to make changes to Title IX, particularly since its initial deadline arrived in May last year without a proposal. The department in December promised to finalize the regulations by March this year, which will be the third deadline for the reforms.In addition to the changes to Title IX, the department has also said that it will be introducing another proposal addressing rules for student athletes who identify as transgender—also by the March deadline.LGBT advocacy groups, with the support of the Democratic Women’s Caucus and Congressional Equality Caucus in Congress, have eagerly been waiting for details of the Biden administration’s sports gender policies, hoping that the reforms will include blanket bans for federally-funded schools that ban individuals who identify as transgender from participating in women’s sports outlined in April.Included in that proposal were also rules allowing school and college sports to restrict trans-identifying students from participating on the condition that educators act to minimize harm to trans-identifying students as well as adhering to any other guidelines issued by the department.The April update did not outline details of how the Biden administration proposed to strengthen protections for student survivors of sexual assault, or protections for LGBT students.After the White House budget office, the Title IX proposal will also have to be reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. That review could take up to 90 days.The department told gender policy news outlet “The 19th” in December that it had received more than 240,000 public comments on its Title IX rule proposals in spring, and 150,000 comments on its gender in sports policy.

The move comes amid speculation over whether the Biden administration will blow through a third self-imposed deadline on finalizing Education Secretary Miguel Cardona's Title IX rule that covers sexual misconduct and codifies protections for gender identity. | Evan Vucci/AP By Bianca Quilantan 02/03/2024 11:23 AM EST Link Copied A long-awaited policy that mandates how schools respond to sexual misconduct and codifies protections for transgender students is being reviewed by the White House for final approval. The Education Department, which has been under pressure from Democrats and civil rights groups to finish its final Title IX rule, sent the regulation to the Office of Management and Budget on Friday, according to its website — a key procedural step before it can be made public. The highly anticipated regulation is expected to unravel much of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ Title IX rule, a defining aspect of her tenure. Her rule, which took effect in August 2020, narrowed the definition of sexual harassment and directed schools to conduct live hearings with cross-examination for sexual misconduct investigations. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring all students are guaranteed an educational environment free from discrimination on the basis of sex,” an Education Department spokesperson said in a statement. “The Department of Education has taken the next step to advance a rule, first proposed in 2022, that strengthens protections for students from sexual harassment and for LGBTQI+ students.” The move comes amid monthslong speculation over whether the Education Department will blow through a third self-imposed deadline on finalizing the part of Title IX that covers sexual misconduct and codifies protections for gender identity. The agency is also facing a separate deadline for a section overseeing athletics eligibility where it proposed making sweeping bans on transgender students’ sports participation illegal. While the unified agenda initially listed March of 2024 as the target date for both rules, the department said it is still reviewing the athletics eligibility rule. Timing on when the final sexual misconduct rule will be released is now up to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. OIRA review is limited to 90 days, according to the website, but can sometimes be extended. There is no minimum time for review. Breaking down the timeline: Department officials were initially supposed to finalize the regulation on sexual misconduct and gender identity in May of 2023, but delayed it to October, citing the need to comb through more than 240,000 public comments received on the proposed rule. The rule was then delayed again to March of 2024. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona first unveiled his plan to codify safeguards for transgender students in June 2022. That version of the rule proposed banning “all forms of sex discrimination, including discrimination based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation and gender identity.” Cardona later in April of 2023 released a rule to bolster transgender students’ rights to play on sports teams but with limitations. The proposal was met with more than 150,000 comments. It aims to bar schools from adopting or enforcing policies that categorically ban transgender students from participating on teams consistent with their gender identity. At least 24 states have laws or regulations banning transgender students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project. “The Department is still reviewing a second rule related to athletics, which was first proposed nine months after the first rule, and which received 150,000 public comments which by law must be carefully considered,” the department spokesperson said. The Education Department emphasized that under its proposed rule, “elementary school students would generally be able to participate on school sports teams consistent with their gender identity where considerations may be different for competitive high school and college teams.” Department officials, however, included the caveat that “in some instances, particularly in competitive high school and college athletic environments, some schools may adopt policies that limit transgender students’ participation.” Michael Stratford contributed to this report.

He wants the proposed rule to ban ""all forms of sex discrimination, including discrimination based on sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation and gender identity.”""Sex stereotypes,"" and ""sex characteristics"" pretty much broaden the definition of discrimination to whatever Title IX administrators say it is.The rule against banning trans athletes is going to run into a lot of legal trouble from states that ban all trans people from playing athletics not associated with their assigned gender.Politico:Cardona later in April of 2023 released a rule to bolster transgender students’ rights to play on sports teams but with limitations.

Shane Murnan, who was the principal at John Glenn Elementary School while performing as a drag queen, resigned from his role at Western Heights Public Schools, the district’s superintendent confirmed, according to The Oklahoman. BREAKING: Shane Murnan, the drag queen principal in an Oklahoma elementary school, has RESIGNED!! I started discussing Shane months ago and even flew to Oklahoma to their board meeting where the board protected him. This is a big win for students of Oklahoma!! https://t.co/b6XJkAwScB pic.twitter.com/BDytLtC7NO — Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) February 2, 2024 Murnan’s sexual activities were exposed when conservative content creator Libs of TikTok made a post identifying the elementary school principal as a drag queen performer called “Shantel Mandalay” in August 2023, The Oklahoman reported. One photograph, posted by Libs of TikTok in December 2023, showed Murnan dressed in drag while posing in front of a man’s crotch. “He uses his drag social handles to discuss his work. He also hired a fellow drag queen as a Kindergarten aide,” Libs of TikTok wrote as a caption to the image. State school Superintendent Ryan Walters called for Murnan‘s resignation in August 2023, but the district fought back, vouching for the principal’s “outstanding” reputation. Murnan often had to work away from the school due to threats he received, forcing the district to spend approximately $65,000 in extra costs on security and administrative assistance, according to the outlet. (RELATED: Facebook Suspends ‘Libs Of TikTok’ For Violating Community Standards) Murnan’s resignation will not be official until the school board votes at its next meeting on Feb. 12, Western Heights Superintendent Brayden Savage said, according to the outlet. Murnan’s district email address reportedly no longer functions even though he is still listed as the principal on the school’s website. The district previously defended its decision to hire Murnan in August 2023 despite the 52-year-old’s prior arrests on child porn charges. Savage confirmed that the district followed “unusual hiring practices” in vetting Murnan, and the charges previously brought against the principal were acknowledged in a social media post welcoming him to the school. Murnan was hired by Western Heights Public Schools in June 2023, according to the outlet. He worked at Oklahoma City Public Schools before becoming principal at John Glenn Elementary School.

Shane Murnan, who performs as a drag queen under the name Shantel Mandalay, offered his resignation to the Western Heights School District on January 26. Official acceptance of the resignation is expected when the district votes on it during its next meeting on February 12. Murnan’s outside work activity was originally exposed by the X account Libs of TikTok in August, when it posted a picture of Murnan in drag and also noted that the principal had been previously arrested on child pornography charges. The porn charges reportedly were dropped for lack of evidence. “Meet Shane Murnan- elementary principal at @wh_isd,” the post on X read. “Shane is a drag queen who performs for children and reads books about gender to kids while dressed in drag. Shane was also previously arrested on child porn charges. Would you want this person in charge of your kid’s school?” Meet Shane Murnan- elementary principal at @wh_isd.Shane is a drag queen who performs for children and reads books about gender to kids while dressed in drag.Shane was also previously arrested on child porn charges.Would you want this person in charge of your kid’s school? pic.twitter.com/yNuZyt3HRK— Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) August 30, 2023 The X post attracted the attention of Oklahoma State Schools Superintendent Ryan Walters, who immediately called for the 52-year-old Murnan to resign and began an investigation of Murnan’s teaching certificate and the district’s hiring practices. According to Walters, parents were immediately upset by the revelation. “I’ve heard from parents in Western Heights and throughout Oklahoma who are deeply concerned about the message being sent by a district that would put a drag queen in charge of one of our schools. It is simply unacceptable,” Walters said in announcing the investigation. “Mr. Murnan has been clear that he is ‘very open’ about his alter ego and has shared it not only on publicly available social media but has performed in public libraries under a very thin veil of would-be anonymity. These are not the actions of a school leader concerned about the well-being of children.” Initially, at least, the school district supported Murnan amid the backlash. “Recently, information began circulating about Dr. Murnan and the charges he faced more than 20 years ago for an alleged crime involving child pornography. According to news reports at the time, those charges were dismissed by the court, and the record of the charges has been expunged,” read a district statement from superintendent Brayden Savage. “Since that time, Dr. Murnan has continued to be certified as an elementary school teacher and principal, including having his certificate renewed in April of 2023 and signed by State Superintendent Ryan Walters. The State Department of Education would have conducted another felony background check upon renewing his certification.” According to Murnan, the district’s support began to wane after a meeting between Savage and Walters in December, and he was given an ultimatum to resign or be fired. “It really makes me angry because all this time, [Savage] told me she was supporting me and she wasn’t going to fire me,” Murnan said on NonDoc. “She supported me multiple times with multiple people as witnesses in the room. And then she [said] I have a choice to be terminated or resign.” Drag queens don’t belong in the classroom. This is common sense. @libsoftiktok pic.twitter.com/Efnk3yOeuj— Superintendent Ryan Walters (@RyanWaltersSupt) February 2, 2024 But Walters says Murnan’s departure from the school, whether forced or not, is necessary. “Exposing Murnan and forcing the resignation is a necessary step to protect kids in Oklahoma. Our students will be protected from predatory behavior, and I have been crystal clear that I will not allow Oklahoma schools to become a training ground in drag queen propaganda,” Walters said. Walters recently appointed Chaya Raichik, the founder of Libs of TikTok, to the Oklahoma State Department of Education’s Library Media Advisory Committee.

The former defenceman and the NHL's director of social impact, growth and fan development was in attendance for the first Pride Cup at the league's all-star weekend. The NHL, Scotiabank and Pride Tape hosted players from the Toronto Gay Hockey Association competing in a ball hockey game at Metro Toronto Convention Centre on Saturday morning. ""The overwhelming majority of hockey players and people in the locker rooms are incredibly supportive and incredibly proud to support causes like this and many great positive causes within the hockey community,"" he said, adding that ""there's always a social cost"" with freedom to have one's own views regarding the continued ban on theme-night pre-game jerseys. ""So I think like anything in life when you live in a free country, and in North America, you're going to have different viewpoints. You're not always going to agree with them and that's OK. ""But I think within hockey, we see the overwhelming support for this community and that's incredibly encouraging for me."" Top sports headlines, all in one place The NHL received backlash last year when it halted the theme-night pre-game jerseys for the 2023-24 season last June. It was a result of a handful of players refusing to wear Pride jerseys for differing reasons and that causing a distraction from the league's view. It then issued an updated memo last October which included a ban on Pride Night tape for pre-game warm-ups that brought along further criticism. The NHL then rescinded the ban on the tape, saying players had the choice to support causes with stick tape throughout the season. Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid and Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly were among those who spoke out in disagreement to the league's moves in 2023. Arizona Coyotes defenceman Travis Dermott proceeded to go against the ban on Oct. 21, leading to the league rescinding the ban on the stick tape three days later. ""There's always going to be more to be done, there's always going to be room for more support, more progress,"" Ference said. ""But sometimes it's baby steps. Culture changes, sometimes, frustratingly slow and especially sometimes in sports. ""You deal with that and I think if you do the right thing, you support good people and you support proud, strong communities in hockey, you're always on the right side of history."" Longtime NHL executive and current executive director of the Professional Women's Hockey League Players' Association, Brian Burke, who has long been a strong supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, had called the bans a ""surprising and serious setback"" at the time. On Saturday, however, he had a different tune. ""(NHL Commissioner) Gary Bettman's been a great ally. I think people are focused on the fact that they got rid of Pride sweaters,"" Burke said Saturday. ""They still do Pride Nights, just not the Pride sweaters. The league's been an ally. We haven't got everything we'd like from the league but we get great support. ""I think we just keep going the way we're going and keep adding events, keep adding awareness, keep changing and breaking down the barriers that constrict us,"" he added. ""I see the world as a very different place than when my son came out. … We've made great gains and we got to keep focusing on that and not what hasn't happened."" Pride Tape co-founder Dr. Kristopher Wells found Saturday's event to be a way of fixing the NHL's standing with the community. ""This is about repairing harm that has been done to the community,"" Wells said. ""The Pride Tape ban hurt a lot of people and that's why you saw the worldwide response about that decision. ""So I hope that Pride Cup is a start of building a new relationship. One where we're all working together because at the end of the day, the young people who love hockey, they want the game to love them back."" Bettman was on hand Saturday to present the Pride Cup trophy to the winning side and a $25,000 cheque to the Toronto Gay Hockey Association. Burke and Ference served as coaches to the teams, while PWHL players Alex Carpenter, Emily Clark, Emerance Maschmeyer and Erin Ambrose competed in the game.

The former defenceman and the NHL’s director of social impact, growth and fan development was in attendance for the first Pride Cup at the league’s all-star weekend. The NHL, Scotiabank and Pride Tape hosted players from the Toronto Gay Hockey Association competing in a ball hockey game at Metro Toronto Convention Centre on Saturday morning. “The overwhelming majority of hockey players and people in the locker rooms are incredibly supportive and incredibly proud to support causes like this and many great positive causes within the hockey community,” he said, adding that “there’s always a social cost” with freedom to have one’s own views regarding the continued ban on theme-night pre-game jerseys. Former Edmonton Oilers' Andrew Ference speaks to the media during the Humboldt Hockey Day event in Humboldt, Sask., Friday, August 24, 2018. Ference feels the NHL has made progress in its support of the LGBTQ+ community. The former defenceman and the NHL's director of social impact, growth and fan development was in attendance for the first Pride Cup at the league's all-star weekend. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Kayle Neis “So I think like anything in life when you live in a free country, and in North America, you’re going to have different viewpoints. You’re not always going to agree with them and that’s OK. “But I think within hockey, we see the overwhelming support for this community and that’s incredibly encouraging for me.” The NHL received backlash last year when it halted the theme-night pre-game jerseys for the 2023-24 season last June. It was a result of a handful of players refusing to wear Pride jerseys for differing reasons and that causing a distraction from the league’s view. It then issued an updated memo last October which included a ban on Pride Night tape for pre-game warm-ups that brought along further criticism. The NHL then rescinded the ban on the tape, saying players had the choice to support causes with stick tape throughout the season. Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid and Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly were among those who spoke out in disagreement to the league’s moves in 2023. Arizona Coyotes defenceman Travis Dermott proceeded to go against the ban on Oct. 21, leading to the league rescinding the ban on the stick tape three days later. “There’s always going to be more to be done, there’s always going to be room for more support, more progress,” Ference said. “But sometimes it’s baby steps. Culture changes, sometimes, frustratingly slow and especially sometimes in sports. “You deal with that and I think if you do the right thing, you support good people and you support proud, strong communities in hockey, you’re always on the right side of history.” Longtime NHL executive and current executive director of the Professional Women’s Hockey League Players’ Association, Brian Burke, who has long been a strong supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, had called the bans a “surprising and serious setback” at the time. On Saturday, however, he had a different tune. “(NHL Commissioner) Gary Bettman’s been a great ally. I think people are focused on the fact that they got rid of Pride sweaters,” Burke said Saturday. They still do Pride Nights, just not the Pride sweaters. The league’s been an ally. We haven’t got everything we’d like from the league but we get great support.” “I think we just keep going the way we’re going and keep adding events, keep adding awareness, keep changing and breaking down the barriers that constrict us,” he added. “I see the world as a very different place than when my son came out. … We’ve made great gains and we got to keep focusing on that and not what hasn’t happened.” Pride Tape co-founder Dr. Kristopher Wells found Saturday’s event to be a way of fixing the NHL’s standing with the community.

One where we’re all working together because at the end of the day, the young people who love hockey, they want the game to love them back.” Bettman was on hand Saturday to present the Pride Cup trophy to the winning side and a $25,000 cheque to the Toronto Gay Hockey Association. Burke and Ference served as coaches to the teams, while PWHL players Alex Carpenter, Emily Clark, Emerance Maschmeyer and Erin Ambrose competed in the game.
