SMITH and DASHA LITVINOVA Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print Greece ha become the first majority Orthodox Christian nation to legalize same sex marriage under civil law  At least for the near future  it will almost certainly be the only one Eastern Orthodox leadership  despite lacking a single doctrinal authority like a pope  ha been united in opposing recognition of same sex relationship both within it own rite and in the civil realm  Public opinion in majority Orthodox country ha mostly been opposed  too But there are some sign of change  Two small majority Orthodox country  Montenegro and Cyprus  have authorized same sex union in recent year  a did Greece in 2015 before upgrading to this week s approval of full marital status  Civil union may become more common among Orthodox country gravitating toward the European Union  They remain off the table in Russia  which ha cracked down on LGBTQ  expression  and country in it orbit  Following is a summary of church position and public opinion in the Orthodox world  followed by the situation in individual majority Orthodox land  THE ORTHODOX WORLDEastern Orthodoxy is a socially conservative  ancient church with elaborate ritual and a strict hierarchy  Churches are mostly organized along national line  with multiple independent church that share ancient doctrine and practice and that both cooperate and squabble Roughly 200 million Eastern Orthodox live primarily in Eastern Europe and neighboring Asian land  with about half that total in Russia  while smaller number live across the world  Like other international church body  Orthodoxy ha confronted call for LGBTQ  inclusion  A 2016 statement by a council of most Orthodox church called marriage between a man and a woman  the oldest institution of divine law  and said member were forbidden from entering same sex union Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople  considered the first among equal among Orthodox leader  affirmed that stance in a statement after the Greek vote  But he added that the church must respond to member in such union  with pastoral responsibility and in Christ like love  In country where they are a majority  Orthodox believer overwhelmingly said society should not accept homosexuality or approve same sex marriage  according to survey conducted in 2015 and 2016 by the Pew Research Center  a Washington based think tank Greek Orthodox showed relative tolerance  with half of Orthodox saying homosexuality should be accepted and a quarter favoring same sex marriage  In more recent poll  Greeks overall narrowly supported the marriage law The Greek law validates marriage in the civil realm but doesn t require any church to perform such rite  Nevertheless  Greece s Orthodox leadership unanimously opposed the law in January  saying the  duality of gender and their complementarity are not social invention but originate from God  Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged the church s position but said   We are discussing the decision of the Greek state  unrelated to theological belief  Civil union may be in some Orthodox country  near future  said George Demacopoulos  director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University in New York   In term of civil marriage  I think the country that are in the European Union will eventually all do it   Demacopoulos said   My guess is the assembly of bishop in those country will offer some resistance to the measure  and depending on where you are  that may or may not delay it   UKRAINEIn Ukraine  same sex couple cannot register their status legally In 2023  the issue became acute a many LGBTQ  people joined Ukraine s armed force  That year  a bill wa introduced in Parliament to establish civil partnership for same sex couple  providing basic right such a compensation if one of the partner is killed in action The All Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations   which includes Ukraine s two rival Orthodox church   opposed the draft law  contending that some international entity are using the country s current vulnerability to force unwanted change The legislation remains pending The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2023 that Ukraine violated the right of a same sex couple who sought legal protection provided to married heterosexual couple  Ukraine is majority Orthodox  with various religious minority RUSSIAIn increasingly conservative Russia  President Vladimir Putin ha forged a powerful alliance with the Russian Orthodox Church and ha made  traditional family value  a cornerstone of his rule  juxtaposing them with  perversion  of the West Putin effectively outlawed same sex marriage in the 2020 constitutional revision that added a clause stipulating that marriage is a union of a man and a woman In 2013  the Kremlin adopted what s known a the  gay propaganda  law  banning any public endorsement of  nontraditional sexual relation  among minor After sending troop into Ukraine in 2022  Russian authority ramped up a campaign against what it called the West s  degrading  moral influence  in what right advocate saw a an attempt to legitimize the war Patriarch Kirill of Moscow ha assailed LGBTQ  right  As head of the Russian Orthodox Church  he oversees the world s largest Orthodox flock  He depicted his country s invasion of Ukraine a part of a metaphysical struggle against a liberal agenda that included  gay parade  In November  Russia s Supreme Court effectively outlawed LGBTQ  activism  labeling what the government called the LGBTQ   international movement  a an extremist group and banning it in Russia  In 2021  a survey by Russia s top independent pollster  the Levada Center  showed that only 33  of Russians completely or somewhat agree that gay men and woman should enjoy the same right a heterosexual  a decrease from earlier year BELARUSThe Belarus Family Code defines marriage a a  union between a man and a woman   There is also no legislation prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity Homosexuality wa decriminalized in

mixed result addressing LGBTQ  right a part of effort to join the European Union Tiny Montenegro passed a bill in 2020 allowing same sex partnership   not marriage and with fewer right  In Serbia  a

Aleksandar Vucic ha said he would not sign off a bill on same sex marriage  although Serbia ha had an openly lesbian prime minister for year  Activists have been campaigning for legal partnership Pride march in Serbia are routinely banned or held under tight security  In Montenegro  though same sex partnership are allowed  the highly male oriented society of 620 000 people remains divided over the issue ROMANIA AND MOLDOVARomania is one of the few European Union member that allows neither same sex marriage nor civil union  despite a growing social acceptance of LGBTQ  people In 2023  the

become the first majority Orthodox Christian nation to legalize same sex marriage under civil law  At least for the near future  it will almost certainly be the only one  Eastern Orthodox leadership  despite lacking a single doctrinal authority like a pope  ha been united in opposing recognition of same sex relationship both within it own rite and in the civil realm  Public opinion in majority Orthodox country ha mostly been opposed  too  But there are some sign of change  Two small majority Orthodox country  Montenegro and Cyprus  have authorized same sex union in recent year  a did Greece in 2015 before upgrading to this week s approval of full marital status  Civil union may become more common among Orthodox country gravitating toward the European Union  They remain off the table in Russia  which ha cracked down on LGBTQ  expression  and country in it orbit  Following is a summary of church position and public opinion in the Orthodox world  followed by the situation in individual majority Orthodox land  THE ORTHODOX WORLD Eastern Orthodoxy is a socially conservative  ancient church with elaborate ritual and a strict hierarchy  Churches are mostly organized along national line  with multiple independent church that share ancient doctrine and practice and that both cooperate and squabble  Roughly 200 million Eastern Orthodox live primarily in Eastern Europe and neighboring Asian land  with about half that total in Russia  while smaller number live across the world  Like other international church body  Orthodoxy ha confronted call for LGBTQ  inclusion  A 2016 statement by a council of most Orthodox church called marriage between a man and a woman  the oldest institution of divine law  and said member were forbidden from entering same sex union  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople  considered the first among equal among Orthodox leader  affirmed that stance in a statement after the Greek vote  But he added that the church must respond to member in such union  with pastoral responsibility and in Christ like love   In country where they are a majority  Orthodox believer overwhelmingly said society should not accept homosexuality or approve same sex marriage  according to survey conducted in 2015 and 2016 by the Pew Research Center  a Washington based think tank  Greek Orthodox showed relative tolerance  with half of Orthodox saying homosexuality should be accepted and a quarter favoring same sex marriage  In more recent poll  Greeks overall narrowly supported the marriage law  The Greek law validates marriage in the civil realm but doesn t require any church to perform such rite  Nevertheless  Greece s Orthodox leadership unanimously opposed the law in January  saying the  duality of gender and their complementarity are not social invention but originate from God   Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged the church s position but said   We are discussing the decision of the Greek state  unrelated to theological belief   Civil union may be in some Orthodox country  near future  said George Demacopoulos  director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University in New York   In term of civil marriage  I think the country that are in the European Union will eventually all do it   Demacopoulos said   My guess is the assembly of bishop in those country will offer some resistance to the measure  and depending on where you are  that may or may not delay it   UKRAINE In Ukraine  same sex couple cannot register their status legally  In 2023  the issue became acute a many LGBTQ  people joined Ukraine s armed force  That year  a bill wa introduced in Parliament to establish civil partnership for same sex couple  providing basic right such a compensation if one of the partner is killed in action  The All Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations   which includes Ukraine s two rival Orthodox church   opposed the draft law  contending that some international entity are using the country s current vulnerability to force unwanted change  The legislation remains pending  The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2023 that Ukraine violated the right of a same sex couple who sought legal protection provided to married heterosexual couple  Ukraine is majority Orthodox  with various religious minority  RUSSIA In increasingly conservative Russia

surgery that aim at removing male genitals and creating a vagina  can be pretty bad  and noted that there wa  a growing number of program throughout the world of gender affirmation  probably with a lack of training and not proper training   according to the video of a presentation that the Daily Caller News Foundation obtained through a public record request   Complications can be pretty bad for vaginoplasty and the most dreaded complication is to perforate the rectum while you are dissecting the vaginal cavity   Dr  Alex Laungani  a Canadian surgeon  who ha  expertise in trans surgical care   said at an event sponsored by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health  WPATH   You are essentially dissecting the vaginal cavity between the prostate and the rectum and there s literally no space there   he said   So  you have to create a new plain in a spot that doesn t exist  So  you re very close to the rectum and it s very hard it s very easy to get in there  We don t  I mean  the more you do it  the le risk you have  of course   WPATH is a medical organization that ha published an influential clinical guidance on transgender health care called Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People  SOC   Laungani s presentation  entitled  Foundations in Surgery   wa part of an educational series recorded in September 2022 for licensed clinician seeking WPATH certification in transgender health care  Laungani is a WPATH member  The WPATH Standards of Care recommend that transgender surgeon be educated  trained and supervised on how to perform sex reassignment surgery  However  Laungani said in his presentation that a the number of sex reassignment program had grown  it wa likely some surgeon had not received adequate training   We ve seen a growing number of program throughout the world of gender affirmation  probably with a lack of training and not proper training  for now   said Laungani   And so  you know  better ca any care wa better  probably  than no care  So  it did allow individual to have access to surgery  But it s time just to make sure that we have the right training and that everybody ha the same standard because the patient deserve it   And  so  we need to make sure that  you know  we ll build these training program  fellowship  and thing   he said   And it s really happening now  So  this is going to be something mandatory    Well  you do great only what you do often  right   Laungani said   So  if you do a vaginoplasty every two year  I don t think you could consider yourself proficient  You re going to have more complication   You re not going to follow up  you know  and you re not going to be that interested that you actually go and hang out at these kind of conference and learn from your colleague  because you re not going to do it a much   he said   So  I think you need to dedicate a huge part of your practice to gender affirming care if you are going to do it at all   WATCH  In this WPATH presentation  Laungani gave an overview of vaginoplasty  a surgery that seek to create a vagina by removing male genitalia  surgically creating a vaginal canal  and lining the canal with tissue which often come from other part of the body  Laungani discussed the detail of a vaginoplasty procedure  saying   So  you ll use the skin of the penis to tack it down and invert it and start the beginning of lining of the canal  But you won t have enough skin to line the entire canal to some  there are some rare exception so you ll need some extra tissue there   Laungani said this tissue needed for the vaginal canal can be taken from the abdomen  scrotum  or colon  However  he warned that using colon tissue could increase the risk of complication   Or you could be using even a piece of colon   he said   So  to use colon vaginoplasty  um  usually that s reserved for secondary deepening  We don t do it a a primary intervention because it s more morbid  You get to  you know  you have to cut bowel  you know it s more  you may have  encounter  more complication   said Laungani  One article published in 2023 in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery stated   Penile inversion vaginoplasty  PIV  is a common procedure for transfeminine patient  with the goal of creating a functional vaginal canal and clitoris and a natural appearing vulva  Creation of the neovagina requires opening the prerectal space  most commonly from a perineal approach  and the reported rate of rectal perforation during this dissection range from 3  to 5    A slide in the WPATH presentation listed possible complication of vaginoplasty  which include minor wound dehiscence  vaginal stenosis  recto vaginal fistula  pelvic floor dysfunction  and clitoris necrosis  During the presentation  Laungani noted the rate of wound dehiscence  a complication in which a surgical incision reopens  could be a high a 75    I think for the dehiscence you can expect a much a probably 75 percent   he said  In the recording  Laungani explained that within the first week after surgery  a vaginoplasty patient must begin regularly dilating the surgically created vagina  sometimes called a neovagina  to prevent closure  He described dilation a a sometimes painful  time consuming process  saying patient have to dilate themselves up to four time a day  Screenshot from the WPATH Presentation Showing Dilation Schedule Following Vaginoplasty Surgery   A s soon a we remove that vaginal stent  we start dilating because there will be a tendency from the body to want to contract and close that  considered a a wound sort of  So  you ll have to fight that contraction and then dilate quite a bit at first  Which is  you know  what the patient call a full time job for the first few month because it s four time a day  It s a lot   said Laungani  During a question and answer segment  Laungani wa asked if there were any non surgical intervention to redialate a neovagina that had not been dilated for approximately two year   That scar tissue is really rock hard  It s like concrete  You can t  once it s settled  you won t  be able to just go  even with tiny dilator  and then increase the size of the dilator  It s just not going to work  So  it ha to be surgical   responded Laungani  Laungani wa also asked about sexual function after vaginoplasty   Can they orgasm still   a person asked him   I wish we had more data on that   Laungani said   But the answer is  Yes  they can  For some individual definitely do relate that either by self palpitation or through penetration or other sexual activity that they have around the clitoris    The only thing we know is that there s going to be more tendency to be able to orgasm if you were to  if you were able to orgasm before surgery  So  but you know  some  the patient who were not masturbating before surgery  then you would have potentially more issue to reach that orgasm after surgery   Laungani said  The Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported that Dr  Daniel Metzger  a WPATH certified pediatric endocrinologist  warned that if puberty blocker are started too early  boy may not develop the genital tissue needed to create a surgical vagina later in life   When you think about vaginoplasty  the creation of a vagina in an assigned male  you need tissue  genital tissue  to create that vagina   said Metzger   And if we are taking an 11 year old boy  who doe not have a lot of genital tissue and blocking puberty right there  we re preventing the growth of the vagina for down the road   WPATH and Dr  Alex Laungani did not

for now   said Laungani   And so  you know  better ca any care wa better  probably  than no care  So  it did allow individual to have access to surgery  But it s time just to make sure that we have the right training and that everybody ha the same standard because the patient deserve it   And  so  we need to make sure that  you know  we ll build these training program  fellowship  and thing   he said   And it s really happening now  So  this is going to be something mandatory    Well  you do great only what you do often  right   Laungani said   So  if you do a vaginoplasty every two year  I don t think you could consider yourself proficient  You re going to have more complication   You re not going to follow up  you know  and you re not going to be that interested that you actually go and hang out at these kind of conference and learn from your colleague  because you re not going to do it a much   he said   So  I think you need to dedicate a huge part of your practice to gender affirming care if you are going to do it at all   Screenshot from the WPATH Presentation Showing Dilation Schedule Following Vaginoplasty Surgery In this WPATH presentation  Laungani gave an overview of vaginoplasty  a surgery that seek to create a vagina by removing male genitalia  surgically creating a vaginal canal  and lining the canal with tissue which often come from other part of the body  Laungani discussed the detail of a vaginoplasty procedure  saying   So  you ll use the skin of the penis to tack it down and invert it and start the beginning of lining of the canal  But you won t have enough skin to line the entire canal to some  there are some rare exception so you ll need some extra tissue there   Laungani said this tissue needed for the vaginal canal can be taken from the abdomen  scrotum  or colon  However  he warned that using colon tissue could increase the risk of complication   Or you could be using even a piece of colon   he said   So  to use colon vaginoplasty  um  usually that s reserved for secondary deepening  We don t do it a a primary intervention because it s more morbid  You get to  you know  you have to cut bowel  you know it s more  you may have  encounter  more complication   said Laungani  One article published in 2023 in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery stated   Penile inversion vaginoplasty  PIV  is a common procedure for transfeminine patient  with the goal of creating a functional vaginal canal and clitoris and a natural appearing vulva  Creation of the neovagina requires opening the prerectal space  most commonly from a perineal approach  and the reported rate of rectal perforation during this dissection range from 3  to 5    A slide in the WPATH presentation listed possible complication of vaginoplasty  which include minor wound dehiscence  vaginal stenosis  recto vaginal fistula  pelvic floor dysfunction  and clitoris necrosis  During the presentation  Laungani noted the rate of wound dehiscence  a complication in which a surgical incision reopens  could be a high a 75    I think for the dehiscence you can expect a much a probably 75 percent   he said  In the recording  Laungani explained that within the first week after surgery  a vaginoplasty patient must begin regularly dilating the surgically created vagina  sometimes called a neovagina  to prevent closure  He described dilation a a sometimes painful  time consuming process  saying patient have to dilate themselves up to four time a day    A s soon a we remove that vaginal stent  we start dilating because there will be a tendency from the body to want to contract and close that  considered a a wound sort of  So  you ll have to fight that contraction and then dilate quite a bit at first  Which is  you know  what the patient call a full time job for the first few month because it s four time a day  It s a lot   said Laungani  During a question and answer segment  Laungani wa asked if there were any non surgical intervention to redialate a neovagina that had not been dilated for approximately two year   That scar tissue is really rock hard  It s like concrete  You can t  once it s settled  you won t  be able to just go  even with tiny dilator  and then increase the size of the dilator  It s just not going to work  So  it ha to be surgical   responded Laungani  Laungani wa also asked about sexual function after vaginoplasty   Can they orgasm still   a person asked him   I wish we had more data on that   Laungani said   But the answer is  Yes  they can  For some individual definitely do relate that either by self palpitation or through penetration or other sexual activity that they have around the clitoris    The only thing we know is that there s going to be more tendency to be able to orgasm if you were to  if you were able to orgasm before surgery  So  but you know  some  the patient who were not masturbating before surgery  then you would have potentially more issue to reach that orgasm after surgery   Laungani said  The Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported that Dr  Daniel Metzger  a WPATH certified pediatric endocrinologist  warned that if puberty blocker are started too early  boy may not develop the genital tissue needed to create a surgical vagina later in life   When you think about vaginoplasty  the creation of a vagina in an assigned male  you need tissue  genital tissue  to create that vagina   said Metzger   And if we are taking an 11 year old boy  who doe not have a lot of genital tissue and blocking puberty right there  we re preventing the growth of the vagina for down the road   WPATH and Dr  Alex Laungani did not respond to a request for comment        Megan Brock is a reporter at Daily Caller News Foundation  Photo  Alex Laungani  by Alex

CQ Roll Call file photo  By Nina Heller Posted February 15  2024 at 5 34pm Lawmakers are asking for answer after a guest chaplain known for his incendiary preaching wa sponsored by Speaker Mike Johnson to give the House s daily opening prayer last month  according to a letter sent to the speaker and the Office of the Chaplain signed by 26 Democratic House member  The letter describes pastor Jack Hibbs a  a radical Christian Nationalist who helped fuel the January 6th insurrection and ha a long record of spewing hateful vitriol toward non Christians  immigrant  and member of the LGBTQ community   Hibbs should not have been allowed to deliver the opening prayer on Jan  30  argues the letter  which wa led by Reps  Jared Huffman of California  Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin   After we picked our jaw up off the floor upon learning that this hate preacher had been allowed to give a guest invocation  I think many of u decided we need to start calling this out   Huffman told Roll Call  The letter accuses Johnson of hosting  an ill qualified hate preacher  who share his own  Christian nationalist agenda   and point to guideline for hosting guest chaplain that he may have ignored  In a video posted to his YouTube channel last year  Hibbs called transgender people part of a  sexually perverted cult   He is also a supporter of conversion therapy for LGBTQ people and launched a national campaign requiring school to out transgender student to defeat  demonic and dark satanic power   In his invocation delivered in the House chamber on Jan  30  Hibbs called for  repentance of our national sin   and used the word  holy fear   which the letter argues were  allusion to the militant and fanatical agenda he preaches about the LGBTQ community  Jews  Muslims  and anyone who conflict with his  biblical worldview    Hibbs ha previously called Islam a  death cult  and said Jewish people are under a  God given blindness   For Huffman  the guest appearance represents an affront to  pluralism and religious diversity in this country    We really do continue to elevate certain type of Christian religion above everyone else  in way that I think would have Madison  Jefferson and other founder rolling in their grave   said Huffman  who call himself a  nonreligious humanist  and  along with Raskin  helped found the Congressional Freethought Caucus  The letter seek answer about how Hibbs wa approved to lead the prayer and whether Johnson and the chaplain s office flouted existing guideline  Instructions given to member office say guest chaplain must be from the sponsoring member s congressional district and be known personally by the member  They also say the sponsoring member should plan on giving the first One Minute Speech of the day to personally welcome the guest chaplain  Members are limited to one guest chaplain per Congress  and date for such a prayer must align with the last legislative day of the week  Hibbs lead Calvary Chapel Chino Hills  which is located in Southern California  not in Johnson s district in Louisiana  and the letter detail other deviation from the guideline  The speaker s office did not

been speaking out themselves and have been telling very compelling story about their own personal circumstance and the impact that these policy would have on them   Koshan said in an interview   So  we re just trying to add to the discussion with the type of expertise that we can bring forward here  which is the legal expertise that put all of these issue in the framework of the Charter   The

that parent are principally responsible for their child up to and including age 15  At age 16 or 17  that s of course when kid develop a little bit more autonomy   Story continues below advertisement Koshan previously told Global News there s no set age at which a child can be considered a mature minor  and is instead identified on a case by case basis depending on the minor s maturity  understanding of the decision and the context of the decision The premier claimed a mature minor making decision wa  fairly rare   I think that the practice ha been that we do rely on parent to be able to provide for their kid   Smith said on Feb  1 Restricting trans woman from participating along their cisgendered counterpart would  likely violate all woman and girl  right to privacy and bodily integrity under section 7 of the Charter by encouraging practice of  gender verification    the open letter state  2 04 Alberta LGBTQ2 community member meet with cabinet minister on gender policy  Cruel and unusual punishment  The open letter said the  state imposed psychological distress  imposed by that  cruel choice  of either self misgendering or facing unsupportive parent would also violate youth s right to not be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment  under section 12 of the Charter  Story continues below advertisement In the video announcing the policy and at subsequent news conference  Alberta Premier Danielle Smith appeared to be relying on existing law to protect child from any violence that stemmed from the policy  We have child protection law that will be strictly enforced   Smith said on Jan  31 The open letter said the existing child protection legislation is  insufficient   and would require child to report their own parent to child protection authority  This reliance on child protection law is completely unrealistic and untenable  and exacerbates the violation of the Charter and human right legislation discussed above   the letter read Ashley said the child protection system in Alberta is already under stress and that the child welfare system is overburdened  Laws need to be there in order to protect precisely those who do not feel safe telling their parent  because that s the population that we re actually thinking about  That s the population that s actually being impacted by these change in law   they said  Trending Now A woman dying of cancer  and the struggle to get treatment to reduce her pain Two teen intentionally run down by Abbotsford  B C  driver  police say The legal scholar also took umbrage with the proposed opt in framework for in school instruction on topic including gender identity  sexual orientation and human sexuality  The proposed restriction will cause harm to all youth  especially to those who are vulnerable to sexual violence  including girl and 2SLGBTQ  youth  In addition to the Charter provision mentioned above  the proposed scheme impact youth s right to access to information  which is an important aspect of freedom of expression   Story continues below advertisement Smith said the change to opt in wa to keep parent  in the loop  about what s being taught in school The legal expert also said the policy announced by social medium video on Jan  31 would be inconsistent with Indigenous law  Citing the Final Report on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls that  some First Nations also challenged European norm that understood gender a binary  and how two spirit people were revered and included in social and ceremonial role  Therefore  the Government of Alberta should also be consulting with Indigenous community about the impact of the proposed restriction on Indigenous law   the open letter say  10 27 What is SOGI 123  Equality right  By singling out a historically disadvantaged and vulnerable group for adverse impact  the restriction also would violate the right to equality guaranteed by section 15 of the Charter and the Alberta Human Rights Act   the letter say  Story continues below advertisement The same right would be violated under the proposed sport policy excluding trans woman from participating alongside ci woman  Such a clear distinction based on sex and gender identity unquestionably impairs the right to equality of trans woman under section 15 of the Charter and under the Alberta Human Rights Act   the letter say   Differential treatment cannot be based on needle speculation or stereotype  but must be rooted in clear evidence of need and necessity  On Feb  1  Smith said her government want to enshrine the choice of woman who are assigned female at birth to be able to  participate in a biological female only category while still preserving the gender neutral category and coed opportunity so that everyone ha the ability to participate   The notwithstanding clause The Alberta legal scholar said the use of section 33 of the Charter  the notwithstanding clause  allows government to bypass Charter right and freedom  and severely limit the possibility of judicial review  Story continues below advertisement  If the government genuinely belief that the restriction are in alignment with the best interest of trans youth  invoking the notwithstanding clause should be wholly unnecessary   the letter read   Only if the government belief that neither science nor human right are on their side doe using section 33 become necessary  On Feb  1  Smith said she hope her government won t need to use the notwithstanding clause On Thursday  Smith s office did not respond to a request for comment about the possible use of that section of the Charter Koshan said so far  the Alberta government hasn t provided any justification for the restriction that would fall under  reasonable limit  under section 1 of the Charter  11 25  I hope it doesn t come to that   Premier Smith on notwithstanding clause option for new trans policy The 36 legal expert said that lack of evidence led them to a conclusion about why the notwithstanding clause could be used  Story continues below advertisement  Using the notwithstanding clause to promote partisan political aim at the expense of a small  vulnerable group of youth would be  in our opinion  unconscionable  Ashley said a government s choice to use the notwithstanding clause in matter like these sends a clear message  I think that a government that us the notwithstanding clause is more or le admitting in almost all normal situation that this is a law that indeed violates the right of people   they said That section of the Charter wa included because of the possibility that voter could hold legislator responsible for a cavalier use of the notwithstanding clause However  according to the 2021 census  only 0 67 per cent of Albertans over 15 identified a trans or non binary  To override their right knowing that they are too few to hold the government accountable at the ballot box would be fundamentally anti democratic

with the government s announcement of restriction targeting transgender youth   say the letter  ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW  These restriction will harm two spirit  trans  and gender diverse child and youth by undermining their education  restricting their access to health care  and narrowing their sport and recreation opportunity  We believe these restriction violate their right a enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  Alberta Premier Danielle Smith ha said the fall sitting of the legislature would bring new rule  including restriction on youth changing their name or pronoun at school  a well a on hormone treatment and surgery for gender affirmation The province would also clamp down on transgender female athlete competing in woman s and girl  sport Jennifer Koshan  a law professor at the University of Calgary  said she and her colleague wrote to the UCP government because they want to shine a spotlight on the legal aspect to the debate   Many of these youth have been speaking out themselves and have been telling very compelling story about their own personal circumstance and the impact that these policy would have on them   Koshan said in an interview  So  we re just trying to add to the discussion with the type of expertise that we can bring forward here  which is the legal expertise that put all of these issue in the framework of the Charter  The expert say the proposed change violate multiple section of the Charter  including freedom of expression  the right to security of the person  and say the rule may constitute cruel and unusual treatment The letter also address Smith s refusal to rule out using the Charter s notwithstanding clause to push through the change  We believe that it would be wrong for

University of Calgary law school   We have come together to express our deep concern with the government s announcement of restriction targeting transgender youth   say the letter   These restriction will harm two spirit  trans  and gender diverse child and youth by undermining their education  restricting their access to health care  and narrowing their sport and recreation opportunity   We believe these restriction violate their right a enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms   Alberta Premier Danielle Smith ha said the fall sitting of the legislature would bring new

is  horrendous  a she called for a crackdown on social medium and mobile phone usage Esther Ghey  37  said she recently reported a comment about her daughter  who is transgender  on X  formerly Twitter  but the company did not take it down  finding it did not breach their policy  I ve done a few interview now and once the article are posted on Twitter  the comment are absolutely horrendous  and there s a lot of trans hate that s directed to Brianna   Ms Ghey said  Now  I m all for free speech but I actually reported one of these comment and they came back to say that there wa nothing wrong with what wa being said  It s just complete hate and I don t think that there s a place online for that  Brianna s mother Esther Ghey is calling for a crackdown on social medium and mobile phone usage  PA Brianna  16  wa brutally stabbed to death by Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe  both now aged 16 but who were 15 at the time  after they lured her to Culcheth Linear Park near Warrington on 11 February last year The harrowing four week trial at Manchester Crown Court heard how the  warped  pair had a fascination for violence  torture and murder  and shared a  thirst for killing   with Jenkinson downloading a browser allowing her to search the  dark web  for  red room  showing real life torture and killing video After the pair were sentenced to life imprisonment earlier this month  Brianna s mother Esther Ghey  37  began campaigning for improved safeguarding of child against the risk of accessing harmful content online  including an age limit for smartphone usage and stricter control on access to social medium apps  Ms Ghey said it wa  absolutely shocking that a young person can access the dark web  Brianna herself accessed eating disorder and self harm content on X  which worsened her mental health struggle Ms Ghey said company such a X have a  moral responsibility  to protect young people from harm online  and she belief the Online Safety Act doe not go far enough Brianna  16  wa brutally stabbed to death in Culcheth Linear Park near Warrington on 11 February last year  PA Wire She said  nothing is in the diary yet  regarding a potential meeting with prime minister Rishi Sunak  but added   I am hoping to arrange something soon after I ve had a short break  She said she would like to  get his view  on online safety for young people and to discus her Peace in Mind campaign to train more teacher in mindfulness Referring to the comment made about her daughter  Ms Ghey expressed concern for child and young people seeing  this hateful way of speaking  and she would  like to sit down and speak to the regulator and social medium company    Social medium company  have got u into this mess now and it is their responsibility to get u out of it  and it s something that we can all work on together   she said  Social medium company and mobile phone company have both got a moral responsibility to not think about profit so much and actually think about how their product is impacting the people who are using it  Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe  both now aged 16 but who were 15 at the time  murdered Brianna after they lured her to Culcheth Linear Park near Warrington on 11 February last year  PA Media Ms Ghey s comment came a she announced  75 000 had been raised by Peace in Mind to train more teacher in mindfulness  a cognitive skill focused on being in the present moment The campaign ha raised enough money for a teacher in every school in her town of Warrington  Cheshire  to be trained in mindfulness  with ambition to spread the campaign around the country  I feel that if we did have mindfulness in school from a young age then that may have made  Brianna  more resilient  and she would have been le at risk of the thing that she wa going through when she wa a teenager   Ms Ghey said Ms Ghey recently discussed her campaign to get mindfulness taught in school with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer  which she said wa  a really positive meeting   although Sir Keir did not commit to banning smartphones for young people if Labour won the general election  We explained about mindfulness and how we would like to get into school  and we gave him a roundabout costing and he would like to get more information and is happy to receive how much it would actually cost   Ms Ghey said  I suppose that I understand that he can t commit without having all of the information there  so I think the fact that he s asked for that information is a very positive step in the right direction  Ms Ghey recently discussed her campaign to get mindfulness taught in school with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer  Getty Images Ms Ghey ha found strength in building her daughter s legacy  but added   Obviously  I have bad day and my daughter struggle quite a bit still  We ve completely changed our life so we don t notice the hole where Brianna wa quite so much  We really made a conscious effort to remember her for all the good thing and to remember her for who she wa  Emily Slater  chief executive of the Mindfulness in Schools Project  which is receiving fund raised by Ms Ghey s Peace in Mind campaign to train more teacher in mindfulness  said   We have a fantastic representative in Esther  for parent and for common sense  and I think we d be hard pressed to find many family at the moment  many parent  that aren t asking themselves question about mobile phone use or the wellbeing of their child and young people  Ms Ghey also on Thursday met Ian Russell  the father of 14 year old Molly Russell  who took her own life in November 2017 after viewing harmful material on social medium Speaking together to the BBC  Mr Russell told Ms Ghey that while  it s never been that easy to be a teenager   social medium wa providing a fresh challenge for young people to navigate He said   We both lost child who had seen harmful thing online and  in your case  there were other child involved who had been motivated to murder by what they d seen online  It s almost impossible for a parent to monitor and mirror and know what their child are doing and keep up with all the evolution in all the tech

her daughter when article about her are posted on social medium is  horrendous   Brianna  16  a transgender girl  died after being stabbed 28 time in a park by teenager Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe earlier this year  A judge concluded a  secondary motive  for the killing  wa hostility towards Brianna because of her transgender identity   Brianna s mum Esther Ghey  37  said comment on article posted on X  formerly known a Twitter  following her daughter s death have been  absolutely horrendous  and  absolute hate   She told the PA news agency she reported a comment about her daughter on the social medium platform  but the company did not take it down  finding it did not breach their policy  Join our WhatsApp Top Stories and Breaking News group by clicking this link  Ms Ghey said company such a X have a  moral responsibility  to protect young people from harm online  after her daughter Brianna  struggled with her mental health  which wa worsened by accessing eating disorder and self harm content on the platform  She also said  nothing is in the diary yet  regarding a potential meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak  but added   I am hoping to arrange something soon after I ve had a short break   She said she would like to  get his view  on online safety for young people and to discus her Peace in Mind campaign to train more teacher in mindfulness   I ve done a few interview now and once the article are posted on Twitter  the comment are absolutely horrendous  and there s a lot of trans hate that s directed to Brianna   Ms Ghey said   Now  I m all for free speech but I actually reported one of these comment and they came back to say that there wa nothing wrong with what wa being said  It s just complete hate and I don t think that there s a place online for that   Brianna Ghey  Image  PA  Ms Ghey expressed concern for child and young people seeing  this hateful way of speaking  and she would  like to sit down and speak to the regulator and social medium company     Social medium company  have got u into this mess now and it is their responsibility to get u out of it  and it s something that we can all work on together   she said   Social medium company and mobile phone company have both got a moral responsibility to not think about profit so much and actually think about how their product is impacting the people who are using it   She is campaigning for an age limit for smartphone usage and stricter control on access to social medium apps  Asked what she thought of X owner Elon Musk describing himself a a  free speech absolutist   she added   If people can comment on post that young people are putting up in such a disgusting way and when you report it  nothing happens  it s a bit of a ridiculous title to call himself   Ms Ghey said the Online Safety Act doe not go far enough  Asked what she would say to those in Government and elsewhere who have said the Bill is strong enough to protect young people  Ms Ghey said   Would they still be happy for their child to be scrolling on social medium for the amount of time that most child are scrolling on social medium once the act is in place   I think that  probably  I wouldn t be   One of Brianna s murderer accessed violent content on the dark web a part of the internet which allows user to be untraceable a they plotted to kill the teenager  and Ms Ghey said it wa  absolutely shocking that a young person can access the dark web   She said   Before all of this I didn t even realise that the dark web wa actually a thing  I thought it wa like something that wa just made up in film  and the fact that somebody who is 15 can access it is so disturbing  and it s so worrying  It s beyond belief really   Ms Ghey plan to meet the mother of Scarlett Jenkinson  one of her daughter s murderer  although a date ha not yet been arranged   When I do meet her  it s going to be a very personal and very private thing between both of u   she said  Ms Ghey s comment came a she announced  75 000 had been raised by Peace in Mind to train more teacher in mindfulness  a cognitive skill focused on being in the present moment  The campaign ha raised enough money for a teacher in every school in her town of Warrington  Cheshire  to be trained in mindfulness  with ambition to spread the campaign around the country   I feel that if we did have mindfulness in school from a young age then that may have made  Brianna  more resilient  and she would have been le at risk of the thing that she wa going through when she wa a teenager   Ms Ghey said  Ms Ghey recently discussed her campaign to get mindfulness taught in school with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer  which she said wa  a really positive meeting   although Sir Keir did not commit to banning smartphones for young people if Labour won the general election   We explained about mindfulness and how we would like to get into school  and we gave him a roundabout costing and he would like to get more information and is happy to receive how much it would actually cost   Ms Ghey said  Brianna Ghey s mother Esther Ghey making a statement to the waiting medium outside Manchester Crown Court  after a boy and a girl  both 16  have been found guilty of the murder of the teenager in a park in Culcheth  near Warrington  Brianna  16  wa stabbed with a hunting knife 28 time in her head  neck  chest and back after being lured to Linear Park on the afternoon of February 11  Picture date  Wednesday December 20  2023   Image  PA Wire PA Images   I suppose that I understand that he can t commit without having all of the information there  so I think the fact that he s asked for that information is a very positive step in the right direction   Ms Ghey ha found strength in building her daughter s legacy  but added   Obviously  I have bad day and my daughter struggle quite a bit still    We ve completely changed our life so we don t notice the hole where Brianna wa quite so much  We really made a conscious effort to remember her for all the good thing and to remember her for who she wa   Emily Slater  chief executive of the Mindfulness in Schools Project  which is receiving fund raised by Ms Ghey s Peace in Mind campaign to train more teacher in mindfulness  said   We have a fantastic representative in Esther  for parent and for common sense  and I think we d be hard pressed to find many family at the moment  many parent  that aren t asking themselves question about mobile phone use or the wellbeing of their child and young people   Ms Ghey also on Thursday met Ian Russell  the father of 14 year old Molly Russell  who took her own life in November 2017 after viewing harmful material on social medium  Speaking together to the BBC  Mr Russell told Ms Ghey that while  it s never been that easy to be a teenager   social medium wa providing a fresh challenge for young people to navigate  He said   We both lost child who had seen harmful thing online and  in your case  there were other child involved who had been motivated to murder by what they d seen online  It s almost impossible for a parent to monitor and mirror and know what their child are doing

Cline s post  which drew condemnation from Gov  Spencer Cox and Lt  Gov  Deidre Henderson   who both urged state education official to hold her accountable  On Wednesday  the Utah State Board of

prohibited from attending any Board advisory committee meeting   Both house of Utah s Legislature on Thursday passed a censure resolution against Cline  saying that her  bullying and failure to treat a student with dignity and respect undermine the mission of the USBE and display a selfish indifference to her sworn oath to discharge her board member duty with fidelity    Cline s abhorrent action

member Natalie ClineThe family of a student targeted by Cline told House Speaker Mike Schultz they wanted Cline to be impeached  Trent Nelson   The Salt Lake Tribune  Senate President Stuart Adams  R Layton  and House Speaker Mike Schultz  R Hooper  hold a news conference to address the Natalie Cline situation at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City on Thursday  Feb  15  2024 By Emily Anderson Stern   Feb  15  2024  9 30 p m    Updated  Feb  16  2024  3 28 a m The Utah Legislature voted Thursday to censure embattled Utah State Board of Education member Natalie Cline  who falsely suggested on social medium that a high school athlete wa transgender  despite the student s parent requesting that the Legislature impeach Cline Titled  House Concurrent Resolution Condemning and Censuring State School Board Member Natalie Cline   the resolution detail why lawmaker believe Cline s  abhorrent action  are wrong  It say her action  violate the moral and ethical standard expected of an elected official  particularly one charged with the duty to support our child in public education   Now  therefore   the resolution read   be it resolved that the Legislature of the state of Utah  the Governor concurring therein  condemns and denounces board member Cline s repugnant attack on a student in the strongest possible term and find such behavior irreconcilable with the responsibility of a Utah State Board of Education member  In a statement responding to the vote  the student s father  Al van der Beeken  said   It s not the resolution we were hoping for  but it s a step in the right direction  He continued  saying the family is waiting to see if Cline answer call to resign  adding   It might send a bigger message if the people of Utah have had their eye opened a little more a a result of this and don t reelect her  Our state and our child deserve to be represented by people we can trust and that don t undermine and bully our child  Sandy Republican Rep  Robert Spendlove opened a file to create the resolution last week  with Senate Majority Whip Ann Millner also sponsoring the resolution in the Senate Spendlove said on the House floor Thursday that his resolution didn t open impeachment proceeding against Cline because the Utah State Board of Education had already stripped her of the majority of her duty  The state school board voted Wednesday evening to request that Cline resign from her seat While lawmaker over and over called the resolution censuring Cline  historical   it doe not include binding consequence Because the Legislature censured Cline rather than impeaching her  the GOP school board member will be able to remain on the ballot and participate in the Salt Lake County Republican Party s nominating convention in April  The primary election is in June Cox signed the bill shortly after it passed  saying in a statement that he agrees with the Legislature s action  He acknowledged the possibility of her reelection  saying   we hope the voter will hold her equally accountable this fall  In his monthly appearance on PBS Utah earlier Thursday  Cox expressed thought similar to Spendlove s  What happened yesterday ha effectively removed her from any action with the board   Cox told reporter   Whether or not she s impeached is probably immaterial at this point because that is  in effect  what happened  Two representative   Blanding Republican Rep  Phil Lyman and West Valley City Democratic Rep  Brett Garner   voted against the resolution  Lyman said in a text Thursday afternoon that  Cline s social medium activity  in my observation  did not warrant legislative involvement   adding that he  validate s  the feeling of  the student and her family As Spendlove explained why the Legislature wa not impeaching  Garner shook his head in apparent disappointment  He told reporter after the vote that he did not feel a censure wa a severe enough consequence After the House vote  the Utah Senate unanimously passed the resolution Democrats were largely not included in the discussion a to what action lawmaker should take against Cline   the majority of which happened in caucus meeting  As the House prepared to vote on it  Minority Leader Angela Romero repeatedly mouthed   no   while making eye contact with House Speaker Mike Schultz  Trent Nelson   The Salt Lake Tribune  House Minority Leader Angela Romero  D Salt Lake City  speaks a House Democrats hold a news conference to address the Natalie Cline situation at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City on Thursday  Feb  15  2024 During a news conference after the resolution passed  Romero said she had prepared a substitute resolution that would have started impeachment proceeding  That substitute wa not brought up for debate  We re here talking to the community now  letting the community know that we heard them and we wanted to start the proceeding to impeach Natalie Cline  but weren t given the opportunity on the floor today   Romero said Schultz told reporter in a separate news conference that the substitute wa not considered because lawmaker voted to end debate on the resolution  That decision wa made with a voice vote  not a roll call vote  so it s unclear how many lawmaker may have supported continuing debate and hearing the substitute Prior to the resolution becoming public  Schultz said Thursday morning that the Republican caucus wa  scattered  on how it wanted to approach the issue  so we re trying to narrow everybody s thought   The body  could swing one way or the other  on impeachment  he added The House and Senate Republicans met in a caucus meeting Thursday afternoon  prior to the resolution being made public Impeachment requires the approval of two third of the member of both the House and the Senate   There wa some support in our body for impeachment  but there wa not enough even for a majority vote   Schultz said after the resolution passed The student athlete s parent did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposed censure What the student s parent have saidOne reason member of the House were hesitant to impeach Cline  Schultz told reporter Thursday  is because the controversy then  blow up like a mushroom cloud on a national stage   and would result in further harassment of the student and her family He maintained that position following the vote  saying   Impeachment is a political process that we felt like would put that girl and her family in the middle of a tug of war of sort  and become a political football  and I don t think that s what s best for the girl  for the family  or  honestly  I don t think it s right to give Natalie Cline a national platform to speak from  But the student s parent asked Republican House lawmaker to impeach Cline in a closed caucus meeting two day before the resolution wa made public  van der Beek told The Salt Lake Tribune When asked whether he had a conversation with the family in which they changed their position prior to the vote  Schultz said he had talked with the family  but didn t indicate their position on censure On Thursday morning  Schultz initially mischaracterized to reporter what the family had told representative about their wish  The family ha expressed that they have trust and faith in God  and in the process  and that they would be OK   you know  that it s in God s hand  they re going to let it play out   Schultz said After a reporter pointed out that the student s parent wrote in an op ed published in The Tribune on Thursday morning that they  are asking that  following an adequate due process  we can move towards impeachment of Natalie Cline   Schultz amended his response  I know  they mentioned that to myself and to my caucus   Schultz said   But at the end of the day  they said they re comfortable with the process and they placed it in God s hand  Following Schultz s weekly meeting with journalist  van der Beek said in a call with The Tribune that  essentially  that s what we expressed to them   but said in making those remark  he and his wife were referring to themselves   not the Legislature  We do believe that it s really not in our control   van der Beek said   We just felt like it wa an opportunity for u to express our desire what we would like to happen   which  he added  is impeachment Van der Beek continued   We just continue to move forward and if it s not resignation  if it s not impeachment  which of course is our desire  then I guess the next thing is just to let the voter vote  and do what we can to help support putting someone else in her place at

Next By  Ben Winslow Posted at 1 45 PM  Feb 15  2024 and last updated 2024 02 15 23 43 36 05 SALT LAKE CITY   The Utah State Legislature passed a resolution to censure controversial Utah State Board of Education member Natalie Cline over an incendiary social medium post targeting a student athlete House Concurrent Resolution 18 wa filed and passed both chamber on Thursday before being quickly signed by Governor Spencer Cox  It is the first time in state history that a sitting state office holder ha been censured by the Utah State Legislature  Natalie Cline recklessly used her social medium platform to bully a child   said Rep  Robert Spendlove  R Sandy  who sponsored the resolution Cline  an outspoken social conservative  ha been condemned on Utah s Capitol Hill for a Facebook post she made insinuating that a high school student athlete is transgender  She is not  As a result of the social medium post  the girl s family ha received harassment that continues to this day  At one point  the girl wa receiving security protection The resolution stop short of impeachment  which is something some in the House and Senate had been pushing for  But lawmaker lined up to condemn Cline s behavior Rep  Susan Pulsipher  R West Jordan  said elected official   action do matter   What ha happened here  Cannot be tolerated   said a visibly emotional Rep  Dan Johnson  R Logan  a retired school principal Rep  Jordan Teuscher  R West Jordan  pointed out to his House colleague that Cline is the school board member for his district  He rallied lawmaker in support of the censure  We have to spend our time with someone who ha taken such reckless action that there is no other option for u to take out this time and call out what we see is real evil   he told the House It passed the House on a 71 2 vote  Rep  Phil Lyman  R Blanding  told FOX 13 News he believed the resolution went too far and voter should decide Cline s fate  I m not a big fan of condemnation and I felt like this one had enough political implication  motivation I felt the legislature should respectfully decline to participate in that   he said  acknowledging that his colleague felt otherwise Rep  Brett Garner  D West Valley City voted against the censure motion because it didn t go far enough  I feel like this resolution wa an endorsement of Board member Cline s action  Her continued action  Not a censure at all   he told reporter after the vote House Democrats were frustrated there wa no impeachment  Minority Leader Angela Romero  D Salt Lake City  said their effort to introduce article of impeachment were ignored    Cline s  refusal to acknowledge and address her action through resignation is very disappointing and censorship can only do so much   Rep  Romero said  In the Senate  the resolution passed unanimously  Senate Majority Whip Ann Millner  R Ogden  condemned Cline for what she did and said they need to stand against bullying  No child should be bullied especially by adult let alone by an elected official in a position of trust  Not only wa this girl targeted  but her family  her basketball team and her entire school   she told her Senate colleague Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla  D Salt Lake City  said her caucus would support the resolution  However  she warned her colleague that if Cline posted anything similar in the future she would not hesitate to seek impeachment  We are glad we could come together on this and stand united in censuring an individual that ha a lengthy history of hateful and discriminatory rhetoric including homophobic  transphobic and racist comment   Sen  Escamilla said Cline ha declined to comment to FOX 13 News on the post and the outrage over it  pointing instead to another Facebook post where she apologized for negative attention her post drew to  innocent student and their family   When legislation is created targeting the transgender community  people will try to judge body to assume who s in that community   said Sue Robbins with Equality Utah  This year  we passed a bill that is wrapped around bathroom and other privacy space  and we will see people try to be the enforcer and judge other people s body to determine whether they belong in a space or not   she said   We ve warned the legislature about this before they pas the bill  Natalie Cline s social medium post is ground for impeachment  said Jeff Merchant  Executive Director of the Alliance for a Better Utah  This is a situation where we had a member of the state School Board engage in cyberbullying against a student  and the legislature decided to slap her on the wrist   he said Al Van Der Beek  the father of the student who wa targeted by Cline  sent the following statement to FOX 13 News  It s not the resolution we were hoping for  but it s a step in the right direction  We ll wait and see if Ms  Cline follows through with what her peer on state board  the governor  member of the legislation and thousand of parent recommend she doe and resigns  It might send a bigger message if the people of Utah have had their eye opened a little more a a result of this and don t re elect her  Our state and our child deserve to be represented by people we can trust and that don t undermine and bully our child  Utah political leader have repeatedly called for Cline to resign  House Speaker Mike Schultz said he and other member of House GOP leadership met with Cline last week  whom he said ha  dug in  and refused to resign from office  I wa really disappointed with Natalie s comment   the Speaker told reporter of the meeting   I think Natalie  unfortunately  feel like she s the victim in this and it s sad  Speaker Schultz said he also ha been speaking with the family of the girl targeted in the social medium post  and he wanted to do what is best for her and her family  Asked by FOX 13 News why he didn t pursue impeachment  Speaker Schultz candidly said the House did not have the two third majority to proceed He also suggested impeachment would become a national medium circus and he didn t want Cline to have the platform  I don t think that s what s best for the girl  for the family or honestly  I don t think it s right to give Natalie Cline a national platform to speak from   he said   And that would do that  In a couple short month  the voter will hold her accountable at the ballot box  On Wednesday night  the Utah State Board of Education met and voted unanimously to strip Cline of her duty and censure her  Cline refused to attend the meeting Under Utah law  the board cannot remove her from office  The House of Representatives in the Utah State Legislature could impeach her from office At his monthly news conference on Thursday  Governor Spencer Cox said he supported impeachment of Cline in the House of Representatives  but said the state school board s action did  effectively impeach  her  Whether or not she s impeached probably is immaterial at this point because that s in effect what happened  She s not participating in meeting  she s not able to participate on committee  she doesn t have authority to put agenda item on   the governor said   That s effectively what ha happened  But absent impeachment  there is a chance that Cline can be re elected  As FOX 13 News reported last week  Gov  Cox and Lt  Governor Deidre Henderson both personally donated to the campaign of Amanda Bollinger  who is challenging Cline for the Republican nomination for school board The governor acknowledged the possibility that voter could send Cline back to the state school board for another term  In other state  he pointed out  the state school board is appointed by the governor The American Civil Liberties of Utah blasted state political leader for creating a climate that allowed the Cline situation to happen thanks to a series of bill over the year targeting transgender people  And despite warning of the consequence from kid  parent  teacher  medical professional  and advocacy group  we are seeing tragic and embarrassing result where adult are targeting child  We can t be surprised when policy violence lead to community violence and leadership violence   the group said in a statement  later adding  Until state official repudiate these law  we will all suffer the legal and social consequence they have created  It doesn t have to be this way  We call on Utah s lawmaker to repeal all law attacking the right of LGBTQ  people in Utah that have created an environment of dehumanization  exclusion  and bullying   Copyright 2024 Scripps Media  Inc  All right reserved  This

in November Publicly Schooled By Benjamin Wood  BjaminWood Tweet Pin It Email Print Favorite Saving  Utah Board of Education State school board member Natalie Cline wa denounced and censured by the Utah Legislature on Thursday  UNIVERSITY Utah Gov  Spencer Cox said Thursday that the question of whether to impeach controversial state school board member Natalie Cline is effectively moot after Cline s board colleague voted to take disciplinary action against her on Wednesday  In a unanimous decision  the Utah Board of Education adopted a resolution censuring Cline and formally seeking her resignation  stripping her of board committee assignment and her power to place item on the board agenda  and prohibiting her from attending advisory meeting  The vote followed a week of widespread condemnation against Cline  with lawmaker  local district school board  city council and advocacy group calling for her resignation and or removal after Cline falsely insinuated on social medium that a high school athlete wa transgender  posting the student s image and identifying information and generating a torrent of hateful and dangerous rhetoric from Cline s follower  Speaking to reporter at his monthly televised press conference at PBS Utah  Cox said he supported the school board s action  adding that it ha the practical effect of ending Cline s power and influence over public education   What I think should be done is I think she should resign  That s the right thing to do that s the best thing to do   Cox said   Whether or not she s impeached probably is immaterial at this point  That is  in effect  what ha happened   click to enlarge Laura Seitz   Pool Photo Gov  Spencer Cox take question at his monthly televised press conference on Thursday  Feb  15  2024 By Thursday afternoon  both chamber of the Utah Legislature voted to approve a resolution censuring Cline  denouncing and condemning her  repugnant  behavior in the  strongest possible term   Sandy Republican Rep  Robert Spendlove  the resolution s House sponsor  said that lawmaker were in  uncharted territory  with no comparable example in state history  But Cline  he said  had violated the public trust   The action of Miss Cline are so outrageous  so abhorrent and so reprehensible that we must act   Spendlove said  While the Senate wa unanimous in it vote for the censure  two House member opposed the resolution  Rep  Brett Garner  D West Valley  and Rep  Phil Lyman  R Blanding  Garner released a statement suggesting that  without the launch of impeachment proceeding  the resolution did not go far enough in response to Cline s action  Alternately  Lyman said that condemnation is a strong action for lawmaker to take   Natalie Cline s social medium activity  in my observation  did not warrant legislative involvement   Lyman said   I have also observed the action of some who may have political motif   On impeachment  Spendlove said the state is better served by acting quickly to condemn Cline and that an effort to remove Cline from office would likely feed into her hunger for notoriety   These people crave attention and they will do anything to get this attention  even resorting to outrageous and abhorrent behavior   Spendlove said  Cline issued a muddled apology after deleting the initial post that incited the backlash but ha otherwise defended herself and her action in subsequent statement  Prior to the school board s vote to censure her  Cline accused her colleague and other critic of engaging in  election interference  a she is up for election against challenger who are broadly expected to defeat her if she attempt to weather the current controversy and remain in the race   Hardened criminal get better due process than I am being provided   Cline wrote on Facebook   Is a decision by the  School  Board legitimate if you don t provide the accused with proper due process right    Asked about Cline s claim on Thursday  Cox wa dismissive of the insinuation  noting that the otherwise ideologically divided school board wa united in it disdain for Cline s behavior  He also dismissed the idea that he and lawmaker were complicit in creating an environment of gender vigilantism by their passing and his signing of anti transgender legislation restricting a person from participating in sport  accessing health care and  new this year  using gender designated restroom and locker room that correspond with their gender identify   We are all personally responsible for our action  Natalie Cline is an adult  this is not the first time that she ha done thing like this   Cox said   Even if this young person wa transgender  it would still have been inappropriate  That is not who we are or what we should be doing     I think you see that with the backlash the backlash ha been profound  it s been unanimous   Cox also spent a considerable amount of Thursday s press conference talking about the immigration crisis at the southern U S  border and it potential impact on November s presidential election  Cox suggested that President Joe Biden s poor handling of the crisis would cost him the election and lead to a second term for former President Donald Trump  An occasional critic of Trump  by Republican standard  Cox said he would not be voting for the former president and would prefer to see Nikki Haley win the Republican nomination  but wa nonetheless prepared to work with whomever occupies the White House in January   I would love to see Haley nominated and win but I think it s pretty clear that s not going to happen   Cox said   I don t hate people that support Donald Trump  I know why they do that and I think we would be better off asking that question   Cox wa critical of both Biden and Trump s advanced age  suggesting that U S  president should not be octogenarian  He said if either of the major party abandoned their frontrunner and nominated another  younger candidate  that party would likely win in November by  historic  margin   I think we re making a huge mistake a Americans  we should be nominating different people   Cox said   I think people support president Biden because he s not Donald Trump  When you put another candidate like Nikki Haley on the ballot  people don t support president Biden   click to enlarge Larry H  Miller Company A rendering of The Power District and a new Major League Baseball stadium along the Jordan River  planned for development on Salt Lake City s west side  On other topic  Cox continued to express optimism that Utah will launch Major League Baseball and National Hockey League team in the coming year  Just before his press conference  the Larry H  Miller Company released new rendering for their proposed baseball stadium on the west side of Salt Lake City and announced a  3 5 billion investment into development of the so called Power District on North Temple   We are passionate about this once in a generation opportunity to invest in our capital city   Miller Company CEO Steve Starks said in a prepared statement   This project will serve a a vibrant extension of and gateway to downtown Salt Lake  complement the mission of the State Fairpark  and brings the Jordan River to life  The Power District will be a gathering place for Utah s family to live  work  play and enjoy the best view in Major League Baseball   Cox reiterated that while he s opposed to  writing out a check to billionaire  to build sporting facility  he support and anticipates tax increment financing and other incentive being made available to shape and facilitate investment in the area  which wa long neglected by both the state and city   This is kind of an outside indication that everything we ve been working on for the past decade is working and Utah s arrow is pointing up   Cox said  Cox also commented on the litigation filed by opponent of the new Utah State Flag  seeking to overcome their deficit in a signature gathering campaign that attempted to place adoption of the new design on the ballot for a public vote   I think it s a tremendous waste of resource   Cox said   I m confident that like everything else they ve tried so far will fail a

 UPDATED  February 15  2024 at 8 28 a m The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday that Children s Hospital Colorado is discriminating against transgender patient by refusing to perform surgery it offer to cisgender patient with other condition  The lawsuit  filed in Denver District Court  also state the hospital is discriminating on the basis of disability because gender dysphoria   distress when a person s sense of their gender doesn t align with physical characteristic   is a medical condition  The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of an 18 year old Denver patient who wa on track to receive chest reconstruction surgery before the Aurora hospital discontinued gender affirming surgery for adult last year  Representatives of Children s Hospital Colorado said they couldn t comment Wednesday because the hospital hadn t yet been served with the lawsuit  The main reason young cisgender men seek chest reconstruction surgery is if they developed feminine appearing breast because of hormonal imbalance or medication side effect  according to the lawsuit  The hospital also sometimes performs breast reduction surgery on young woman who have excessive chest tissue that cause pain  the lawsuit said  The patient  who is identified in the lawsuit by the pseudonym Caden Kent  started receiving care at Children s for mental health concern when he wa 16  He wa diagnosed with gender dysphoria a few month later and had undergone about eight month of assessment before determining he wa a candidate for surgery once he turned 18  In July  the hospital announced it would no longer offer chest reconstruction surgery for transgender patient  though they could still receive other gender affirming treatment  including counseling  puberty blocker and hormone therapy  The hospital had only offered surgery to patient who were at least 18  At the time  the hospital stated it had received an unusual number of referral for gender affirming surgery a program shut down in other state  and that it didn t shut down the program because of threat  It came at a time when child s hospital were scrubbing reference to transgender care from their website  though  with at least 21 removing information in 2022  According to the lawsuit  Kent chose to undergo surgery at Children s because he received other care there  and hoped to recover from the surgery before leaving for college in the fall  Other surgical provider who accept his family s insurance were booked up  meaning his parent will have to pay out of pocket for him to undergo the surgery in that time frame  Kent had resorted to chest binding to ease his dysphoria  but found himself withdrawing from others when binding became too painful and he couldn t otherwise hide the breast tissue  the lawsuit said  Related Articles Health   Intermountain Health cut back on student loan reimbursement for Colorado nurse Health   Definition of child abuse in Colorado law should be

Janelle Finch Published  2 59 PM MST February 14  2024 Updated  7 00 AM MST February 15  2024 DENVER   The ACLU of Colorado filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Children s Hospital Colorado  claiming the hospital s decision to stop offering gender affirming surgery violated Colorado s Anti Discrimination Act  CADA   The lawsuit  filed on behalf of 18 year old Caden Kent  which is a pseudonym  say Kent began receiving care at Children s Hospital Colorado s TRUE Center for Gender Diversity in 2021 when he wa 16 year old  Kent wa struggling with gender dysphoria that prevented him from  living a full life   the lawsuit claim  In December 2022  Kent began discussing chest masculinization surgery with his doctor and care team at Children s Hospital Colorado  the lawsuit say  The surgery typically consists of subcutaneous mastectomy that is followed by reconstruction of the chest  The ACLU s filing say the surgery is regularly performed on transgender men who have a higher risk of developing cancer  Kent and his family chose a plastic surgeon associated with Children s Hospital Colorado  The family wa told that before surgery  they needed to receive letter of support from an endocrinologist and a mental health professional  a well a insurance preauthorization  the lawsuit say  In May and in June of 2023  Kent received the needed letter of support  On July 13  Kent s insurance authorization came in the mail  The next day  Kent s father sent a message through the patient portal to the surgeon s physician s assistant to schedule the surgery  the lawsuit say  The lawsuit claim Children s Hospital Colorado determined it would no longer provide medically necessary surgery to transgender patient for treatment of gender dysphoria beginning on or about July 13   You re on the cusp of living a your true  authentic self and to have that ripped out from under you is a truly devastating thing   ACLU legal director Tim Macdonald said   We ve talked to lot of people in the community that provide support to the trans community and there ha been a lot of outcry for this about why the hospital chose to make this decision and to try and persuade them to go back to treating people fairly and consistent with the law   The ACLU s suit say Children s Hospital Colorado still offer the same procedure to patient  including non pediatric patient  to treat condition other than gender dysphoria  which violates the Colorado Anti Discrimination Act  on the basis of his sex  gender identity  gender expression  and disability   Kent and his attorney requested  An injunction and order that would require Children s Hospital Colorado comply with CADAA fine of  3 500 or actual monetary damagesThree fine for violating CADA  totaling  1 500  You ve taken one of the provider doing these life affirming  life saving treatment and taken them away  that just increase the burden on the remaining entity that will do that and you have people who are in desperate position who really need these surgery  they re going to have to wait longer and try to find other place that will do the surgery   Macdonald shared  on behalf of his client  Children s Hospital Colorado said they did not immediately have a statement because they had not yet been served with the lawsuit  To this  Macdonald said the lawsuit should not have come a a surprise   Before we filed the lawsuit  we sent them a letter saying we thought this wa a violation of anti discrimination law  so this is not something that came out of the blue   Macdonald said  The letter to Children s wa sent via email on July 31  2023  shortly after the hospital moved to ban the surgical practice   We re pressing our shoulder against the wheel and we re going to try to make sure that the wheel of justice turn a quickly a they can so that Children s will start providing the care that we believe the hospital is lawfully obligated to provide and were providing up until July

by fellow rightwing leader in OntarioLeyland CeccoWed 14 Feb 2024 08 06 ESTLast modified on Wed 14 Feb 2024 10 13 ESTAt the end of January  Danielle Smith  the premier of Alberta  announced a list of policy change targeting transgender youth in the Canadian province  including a ban on hormonal treatment  puberty blocker and gender confirmation surgery for child 15 year old and younger  The move marked the most restrictive rule on gender confirmation in the country A few day later  Doug Ford   the Conservative premier of Ontario  and one of the most influential politician in Canada   wa asked whether his government intended to follow Smith s policy   No   he told reporter   We have a lot here  and we re leaving everything alone  Canada province us constitutional override to advance pronoun legislationRead moreThe two conservative leader  contrasting view on care for transgender youth highlight the limit of a culture war apparently imported to Canada from the United States  The issue  which affect only a slim minority of youth across the country  ha nonetheless sharply divided political leader within the conservative movement  with some believing it is a losing political issue that put them on the wrong side of public opinion In a video posted to social medium on 31 January  Smith announced a string of what she described a policy change  She said top and bottom gender confirmation surgery would be banned for minor under age 17  although bottom surgery is already limited to adult  While top surgery is permitted in Alberta  reporting also suggests only eight youth received surgery for gender confirmation last year Under the new proposal  hormone therapy will only be available to teen aged 16 and older  with permission from their parent  a physician and a psychologist  instead of at the onset of puberty  Parents will need to give permission before student 15 and under can use a name or pronoun at school other than the one given at birth  Smith said  Students will need to opt in to class dealing with sexuality and gender  reversing previous policy under which parent could have their child opt out of sexual education class  Transgender woman would be banned from woman s sport In the day after the announcement  Smith told the medium the change were motivated by a  concern of what will happen   rather than any current issue facing her government Smith s announcement prompted widespread criticism  both from the Alberta Medical Association  which called on the premier to  reconsider  the proposed policy and to work with  experienced professional  and the Canadian Paediatric Society  which warned that the proposal  will lead to significant negative health outcome  including increased risk of suicide and self harm   It ha to be the most hateful piece of legislation that we ve seen in the LGBTQ community   said Jen Gilbert  a professor at the University of Toronto   They seem to want to take a very small number of young people and turn them into political pawn  And not only doe it hurt those young people  it sends a signal to all queer and trans kid that their identity are up for debate  Gilbert  who specializes in sex education  said Smith s proposed change mirror the legislative activism of conservative in the United States and the burgeoning  parental right movement   These activist are networked with each other and they re sharing technique  strategy about how to affect policy  This particular set of restriction is very similar to what we ve seen proposed in the US   said Gilbert   And these policy that claim to be for the right of parent clearly aren t  what about LGBTQ parent and the parent of queer and trans kid  Months before Alberta waded into the issue  New Brunswick and Saskatchewan   both led by conservative premier   announced change to pronoun policy in school  the latter using the notwithstanding clause of Canada s constitution to block any legal challenge But a a growing list of conservative politician court a fixation on gender issue  Doug Ford ha bucked the trend  Of course  we don t know where he s going to be six month from now  He s the king of the flip flop   said Susan Gapka  a Toronto based community organiser and transgender right activist   But he also care a lot about public opinion  And so his recent stance   that he s not going to get involved in this   ha given me a bit of hope  And hope is something we desperately need right now  Ford ha resisted neat political categorisation amid the deep partisanship that ha come to define modern Canadian politics  He s rightwing  he belief in smaller government  But he s not a driven ideologically a other leader in the province   said Nelson Wiseman  a professor of political science at the University of Toronto   His background is in business  not politics  The Ontario premier also ha a reputation a a leader willing to quickly retreat on major policy proposal if he sens a shift in public opinion against his government  The proposal in Alberta would not stand up to court challenge and so Smith would need to invoke the notwithstanding clause to suspend the fundamental right of trans people if she want to pas these sort of policy   said Gapka   I suspect Doug Ford see this   and realizes it s something he want to avoid  Other Ontario conservative seem baffled by Smith s decision  One told the Toronto Star it wa a  solution in search of a problem  Wiseman said few people in Ontario   or even in Alberta   list gender confirmation for young people a a major voting concern   When you ask people in either province what are the issue  nobody mention this  They talk about inflation  they talk about the environment  And so you re stupid wading into it  But Gapka say the Alberta

consternation of gay and transgender people it doe not amend rule limiting parenthood through surrogacy to single woman and straight couple   Yes  it could be better but the truth is it will also delete so much stress and anxiety from our daily life   said Kalfaki  explaining that a the recipient of reciprocal IVF in the UK   a process where one partner carry an embryo formed with the fertilised egg of the other   their daughter wa a  truly joint creation   Finally we ll not only be recognised legally a partner in marriage but individually a parent   Previously Christina would have had no access to our daughter if anything had happened to me  Niovi would have been sent to a care home  an institution  Few reform in Greece have stirred a much rancour or debate  In the four week since announcing his government s decision to draft the law  the prime minister  Kyriakos Mitsotakis  ha had to face the ire of the powerful Orthodox church  the concern of many MPs in his centre right New Democracy party  ND  and the entrenched social conservatism of a populace resistant to change and suspicious of diversity  Populist tabloid have labelled the law  monstrous  Indicative of the hostility towards the measure  the far right Spartans party leader  Vassilis Stigas  told parliament that the bill wa tantamount to  opening the window  to paedophile a he urged ND MPs to vote against it  while the bishop of Piraeus claimed that homosexuality wa a  mortal sin  and a cause of cancer   Google it and you will see   he told stunned interviewer on Skai TV View image in

people attended a rally in Athens organised by Orthodox religious group to deplore the  sodomisation of Greek society  and pray  in support of the family  With his own lawmaker so divided  Mitsotakis know passage of the bill will only come with support from centrist and leftist party   at a time when he ha faced fierce criticism from the opposition over a spy scandal and curb on medium freedom  But his aide say that is a price the self avowed liberal is willing to pay if it mean changing mindset on an issue that ha remained so taboo The leader  whose party includes rightwing nationalist  had made the revamp of family law a key campaign promise before securing a landslide victory and a second four year term in office last year  Legalising same sex marriage and allowing adoption right for same sex couple wa central to the reform  For him there are no invisible people with fewer right than others   said Akis Skertsos  a minister of state who ha overseen the law   Countries which succeed in sustaining a balance between economic prosperity and personal happiness are those that prioritise civil liberty and rule of law  Skertsos ha led the charge to persuade MPs about the measure s merit  although Mitsotakis say the decision ultimately lie with deputy and he will not enforce party discipline If  a expected  the bill is passed   with the support of other party including the main opposition Syriza headed by Stefanos Kasselakis  Greece s first out gay party leader   the Mediterranean nation will become the 21st in Europe  the 16th in the EU and the 37th country worldwide to legalise same sex marriage But the inflammatory rhetoric in the run up to the vote ha left little doubt that more is needed if Greeks   still prone to dismissing the idea that there were gay people in antiquity   are to embrace 21st century notion of the modern family accepted elsewhere in Europe  Homophobic attack have soared in recent week and gay support hotlines have been overwhelmed with call Stefanos Kasselakis  the political outsider hoping to revive the Greek leftRead moreAccusations of discrimination are not new to Greece  one of the last EU member to introduce civil union for same sex couple in 2015  Before Mitsotakis appointed the first out gay minister  and agay man  Alexis Patelis  a his chief economic adviser in 2019  gay people   at least those who were out   did not hold high office In the absence of visibility  the community remained on the margin of society  with the medium and church often blatantly homophobic  The first gay pride march in Athens were deemed so controversial that participant were pelted with egg   in sharp contrast to today s celebration attended by foreign ambassador and politician Few people know this better than the gallerist Rebecca Camhi  Long regarded a the queen of the Greek capital s contemporary art scene  the 58 year old ha never hidden her sexuality  In a docuseries about prominent Greek woman aired on state TV a few year ago  she raised more than a few eyebrow by talking about family life with her partner  Marina Comninos  and her daughter  Anatolia  now a student at Edinburgh University But on a hot summer s day last year Camhi went further  ensuring the issue got a hearing in polite society when the couple threw a party to celebrate the civil union they had entered into day earlier View image in fullscreenRebecca Camhi  left  and Marina Comninos during a party to mark their civil union  Photograph  supplied A lot of those present  open minded and civilised a they may be  would not naturally find themselves attending a gay event   Camhi said of scene that would go down a unprecedented in the Piraeus yacht club   And at some point in my speech I made a point of making it a point  shouting out to gay friend who were there in sheer joy because people really have no idea what we all went through back in the day  She said the bill before the parliament wa not only groundbreaking but critical for younger Greeks who might be struggling with their sexual orientation   It will have a huge ripple effect and give the message especially to young people who may be afraid to come out  to tell their parent for fear of being rejected  that there are others like you out there  you re not a pariah and you re not alone  I don t think member of the Greek parliament are quite aware how important it is  Until now  same sex couple have had to go abroad if they want to marry  While civil union have provided legal protection  practical difficulty have remained so fundamental that many living abroad simply ruled out ever returning View image in fullscreenKostas Androulakis  husband Michael and their son  Photograph  supplied The minute we land in Greece  our two boy lose one of their parent

others   It s going to be a historic day   said the management consultant  who left Greece back in the 1990s when it wa  all doom and gloom for gay people  and such legislation seemed nigh on impossible Kalfaki could not agree more   Yes there are shortcoming but you can t go from zero to 100 in one bill   she said   It s a start  a brilliant  brilliant start  and it s going to be a very good day   This article wa amended on 15 February  An earlier version said that  if the vote passed  Greece would be the first country in southern Europe to have legalised same sex marriage  this

be the first Orthodox Christian country to do so The Valentine s Day session in parliament follows vocal opposition and protest from the church but also a shift in public opinion which is narrowly supportive of the change Lawmaker Maria Syrengela with the governing New Democracy party called the bill  a small contribution towards the creation of a society without discrimination  during the debate Wednesday  If approved a expected  the bill would grant same sex couple full parental right but not allow male partner to seek child born in Greece through surrogacy  READ MORE Same sex marriage recognition follows decade of struggle for this right campaigner in Greece Hundreds of protester opposed to bill allowing same sex marriage rally in Greek capital Students block Athens street to protest private university possibly coming to Greece The vote on the same sex marriage bill is due Thursday  Here s a look at the bill and why it s happening now  THE SLOW ROAD TO CHANGEThe journey toward legalizing same sex civil marriage in Greece ha been long and contentious  with government in the past shying away from a confrontation with the Orthodox Church Civil partnership for gay couple were made legal in 2015  with conservative opposing the initiative  Promises to extend those right were repeatedly deferred a the country emerged from a severe financial crisis followed by the pandemic  Many same sex couple chose to tie the knot in one of more than a dozen other European Union country which already have marriage equality law  bypassing restriction at home Early in his second term  center right Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is pushing through a series of difficult reform that also include tackling fan violence in sport and ending an official state monopoly on higher education WHY IS THE CHURCH STRONGLY OPPOSED The Greek church s opposition to the marriage bill ha been emphatic The governing Holy Synod of senior bishop sent letter to all lawmaker outlining it objection  A circular with similar wording wa read out during Sunday service at all Orthodox church in the country  and religious group have staged public protest against the proposal  The church regard same sex marriage a a threat to the traditional family model  arguing that support for that model could help address the declining birth rate in many European country Support for that view ha been expressed by other Orthodox country  significantly including the Ecumenical Patriarchate which is based in Istanbul  Turkey Orthodox majority country are all located in eastern and southern Europe  where public acceptance of gay right ha been broadly more apprehensive than in western Europe ADDITIONAL CHANGES SOUGHT Campaigners for LGBTQ  right are calling the bill a milestone reform  a same sex couple would for the first time be recognized a a family unit  Partners who are not the biological parent of the couple s child would have to seek guardianship through adoption  which is more time consuming than the process in many other European country Transgender activist say they are likely to remain in legal limbo and are seeking additional change to family law A RARE POLITICAL AGREEMENTThe political landscape surrounding same sex marriage is complicated  but it offer a rare moment of consensus at a time when politician across the EU are keen to mark out their difference ahead of bloc wide election in June Mitsotakis face dissent from inside his own New Democracy party and need opposition vote for the bill to pas Many from the opposition are keen to back it  Stefanos Kasselakis  the opposition leader  last year became the first openly gay leader of a major Greek political party  Left wing and centrist vote should provide a comfortable majority Political party on the far right are aligned with religious protest  They are unlikely to topple the bill but are seeking to draw support away from Mitsotakis  traditional conservative base of voter  The Associated

equity and inclusion practice at Kentucky s public university won approval from the state Senate on Tuesday after an emotional debate that delved into race relation and what the bill s sponsor portrayed a the liberal bent on college campus  The bill cleared the Senate on a 26 7 vote after a nearly two hour debate  sending the proposal to the House  The GOP ha supermajorities in both chamber  One Democratic lawmaker  predicting a legal challenge  said the final arbiter could be the court  Debates revolving around initiative on diversity  equity and inclusion   known a DEI   are playing out in statehouse across the country  So far this year  GOP lawmaker have proposed about 50 bill in 20 state that would restrict DEI initiative or require their public disclosure  according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill tracking software Plural  Meanwhile  Democrats have filed about two dozen bill in 11 state that would require or promote DEI initiative  In Kentucky  opponent warned the proposed restriction on campus could roll back gain in minority enrollment and stifle campus discussion on topic dealing with past discrimination  The legislation  among other thing  would bar public college and university from providing preferential treatment based on a person s political ideology  It would prohibit the school from requiring people to state specific ideology or belief when seeking admission  employment or promotion  Republican Sen  Mike Wilson said he filed the bill to counter a broader trend in higher education toward denying campus job or promotion to faculty refusing to espouse  liberal ideology fashionable in our public university   He said such practice have extended to student and staff a well   Diversity of thought should be welcomed in our university and higher education   Wilson said   But we ve seen a trend across the United States of forcing faculty  in order to remain employed  to formally endorse a set of belief that may be contrary to their own  all in violation of the First Amendment   Democratic Sen  Reginald Thomas said the proposed restriction would jeopardize success in expanding the number of minority student on Kentucky s university campus   The richness of our diversity and our difference  that s what make u strong   said Thomas  who is Black   We are like a quilt here in America   Wilson responded that there s nothing in the bill to prohibit college from supporting diversity initiative  a long a those effort don t include  discriminatory concept   The legislation set out a host of such concept that would be prohibited  among them that a person  based on their race or gender  bear responsibility for past action committed by other member of the same race or gender  Another is meant to keep people from feeling guilt or discomfort solely because of their race or gender  The state attorney general s office would be allowed to take legal action to compel a school s compliance  Other senator opposing the bill warned that it restriction could have a chilling effect on what s taught on college campus  They pointed to the woman s suffrage movement and the landmark Supreme Court ruling that outlawed segregation of public school a possible example of topic that could be excluded  In supporting the bill  GOP Sen  Phillip Wheeler said it s important for student to delve into the past and learn about the struggle of people  The bill attempt to  get to a balance  to where we re no longer looked at a the oppressor and the oppressees  that we are each judged on our own merit   he said   I think that some of the vitriol that occurs on the campus  some of the topic  have really done more to divide u than unite u   he added  The Supreme Court s June decision ending affirmative action at university ha created a new legal landscape around diversity program in the workplace and civil society  On Tuesday  one of the most emotional moment of the Kentucky Senate debate came when Republican Sen  Donald Douglas talked about his own life experience  recalling that some classmate believed he got into medical school because he wa a Black athlete  despite his academic achievement   You know how

diversity  equity and inclusion By Associated Press Published February 13  2024 7 31 PM Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on Linkedin By MARGERY A  BECK Associated Press Scores of people turned out Tuesday to testify well into the night on bill being considered by Nebraska lawmaker that target diversity initiative and higher education program  mirroring proposal by Republicans across the country  The bill before the state Legislature s Education Committee included one that would ban diversity  equity and inclusion   known a DEI   program and office at state college and university  Another would eliminate tenure for college professor  Similar bill have been introduced in Republican led legislature across the country a the 2024 election year heat up  Sen  Dave Murman  a south central Nebraska farmer who is chair of the Education Committee  introduced the anti DEI bill that ha garnered 13 cosigner who are among the most conservative in the body  Already this year  Republican lawmaker have proposed about 50 bill in 20 state that would restrict DEI initiative or require their public disclosure  Murman characterized DEI program a  a threat to academic freedom  by elevating diversity over meritocracy   Taxpayer funded university shouldn t be used for activism and social change   he said  The 12 people who testified in support of the bill echoed that sentiment  using phrase like  Marxist philosophy   a  you owe me mentality  and  promoting victimhood   Jess Lammers  of Holdrege  wa more blunt  saying DEI is  being inflicted on u by liberal    It excludes white people   he said  Opponents of the bill vastly outnumbered supporter  and dozen took to the mic to encourage lawmaker to reject it  Among them were several young people of color who grew up in the state or Nebraska college student who told lawmaker of the discrimination they ve faced  That included Mia Perales  a University of Nebraska Lincoln engineering student who graduated at the top of her high school class   As a Latino woman in engineering  I have been overlooked by my peer countless time   she said  Ricki Barber  the secretary of the Lincoln chapter of the NAACP  addressed lawmaker supporting the bill   several of whom are UNL graduate and Nebraska college football fan   The transfer portal is a real thing   Barber said   And our Black athlete are watching what happens here   Sen  Loren Lippincott defended his bill seeking to eliminate the tenure system a an idea that s gaining traction in other state legislature  He noted that similar measure have been or are actively being sought in at least half a dozen other state  including Iowa  Florida  North Dakota and Texas  Academic tenure is given to high performing professor   usually those who are long serving and have a catalog of published academic material  Tenure provides a raft of benefit  including higher pay and heightened job security  Advocates say tenure is crucial to protecting academic freedom  Critics have long held that tenure protects poorly performing professor  Many conservative have come to see tenure a a system that protects professor who espouse left leaning ideal   A lot of these horse were pulling their weight in their youth   Lippincott said   But then those horse end up staying in the barn and just eating hay   Lippincott s bill would create a system that would set up annual performance evaluation of all faculty  along with a set of minimum standard of faculty performance and disciplinary action  It would also set up employment agreement that would lay out ground to fire faculty  including for just cause or for financial reason and program discontinuance by the school  A handful of supporter testified in favor of the bill  Most cited a belief that it would help protect the free expression of conservative view of student who are too often silenced by professor who hold power over them  Opponents warned that eliminating tenure would make the already competitive nature of attracting top candidate for faculty job at Nebraska college and university even more difficult   Eliminating tenure would tie both behind our back right at a time we re trying to recruit and retain faculty   said Chris Kabourek  interim president of the University of Nebraska   No other Big Ten university is without tenure  We can t afford not to offer it   It s too early to know whether either measure ha the vote to advance to the full Legislature  Article Topic Follows  AP National Jump to comment   Associated Press Related Articles Philadelphia traffic stop end in

Wellington RadelUSA TODAYThe first ever report on LGBTQ inclusion in video game  by GLAAD  a nonprofit LGBTQ advocacy organization  help tear down the stereotype of who gamers are and what they look like About 17  of active gamers   nearly 1 in 5   are LGBTQ  according to a report by GLAAD  a non profit LGBTQ advocacy organization  which conducted the survey in partnership with Nielsen Games  That is  a 70  increase from the 10  counted in Nielsen s 2020 report  There is an even higher percentage of LGBTQ gamers among younger age group  with  23 to 28  of gamers under 35 identifying a

offer these possible reason why in a statement   Some reason for exclusion are passive  Often  game company have not considered that they should represent LGBTQ people  nor do they see u a a major part of the core gaming audience  Some reason for exclusion are active  Companies worry about pushing away a core audience that they assume are resistant or hostile to LGBTQ content  But seeing

even though more gamers than ever identify a gay  bisexual  transgender or queer  representation of LGBTQ people in game character and storyline is still significantly lacking despite what expert say is a legitimate financial reason to be more inclusive  The character Ellie in  The Last of Us Part I  Playstation Sony Interactive Entertainment Key Facts GLAAD  a non profit LGBTQ advocacy group  on Tuesday released it first ever inclusion report with Nielsen Games that show 17  of gamers aged 13 to 55 identify a LGBTQ  up significantly from the 10  who said the same in a 2020 Nielsen report and much higher than the 7 1  of American adult who identify a lesbian  gay  bisexual or transgender  according to a 2022 Gallup poll  That number is poised to increase in coming year  the study said  a a significantly higher 23  to 28  of gamers under 35 year old identify a LGBTQ and almost one in five member of Generation Z  not just gamers  say they re gay  bisexual or transgender  However  a majority of game lackf LGBTQ character or storyline  with such inclusive game making up only 2  of Xbox  PlayStation and Nintendo s total digital library  GLAAD s report say  The study found that the Nintendo eShop ha the lowest number of game tagged a having LGBTQ content with 50  followed by PlayStation with 90  Microsoft with 146 and Steam with 2 302 English game  though that number drop to 1 506 when game with  adult only sexual content  were filtered out  In the broader context of entertainment  GLAAD found that the gaming industry lag behind that of advertising  3  of ad reviewed in GLAAD s Advertising Visibility Index included LGBTQ representation   primetime television  10 6  of scripted series contained an LGBTQ regular in the 2022 23 season  and film from top 10 distributor  28 5  of which include an LGBTQ character   Catering to an LGBTQ audience would be good for company  GLAAD argued  citing that queer gamers are 1 4 time more likely to buy or play a game with a character that match their gender  29  of all gamers wish there were more prominent LGBTQ storyline in game and 70  of LGBTQ gamers  a well a 46  of non LGBTQ gamers  are le likely to buy a game if it contains harmful trope or stereotype about the gay or transgender community  Art created for Riot Games  celebration of Pride Month Luz Danaee Riot Games Crucial Quote  Game company have avoided making more game with central LGBTQ character because they have assumed that the majority of the gaming audience would not be interested in or openly reject such game   the GLAAD study read   However  our research found that having game with central main LGBTQ character would make no difference to the majority of non LGBTQ gamers   Tangent Video game have also historically struggled with gender and racial representation  Of the 100 top selling and major game released between 2017 and 2021  80  had male main character and 61  of character in game are white  according to a Diamond Lobby study  When video game do feature woman in prominent role  they re often over sexualized or cast a the damsel in distress  trope that have been criticized in Blockbuster game like  Tomb Raider    Mortal Kombat  and  Grant Theft Auto   Key Background The Entertainment Software Association in July found that 65  of Americans play video game about 212 6 million weekly player  Of those people  slightly more than half  53   identify a men and 72  are white  The average gamer is 32 year old with 21 year of gaming experience under their belt  In a study the year before  the association found that nearly all Americans  97   say they re able to see the benefit of video game when it come to stress relief  cognitive skill improvement  social connection and increasing problem solving skill  Overall  the perception of video game and their impact on player  life have improved in the last 40 or so year  Historically  those who worry about the negative impact have expressed concern with desensitization to violence  inappropriate sexual theme  portrayal of religion and the reinforcement of sexist stereotype  Further ReadingGLAAD   GLAAD rewrite the script for LGBTQ acceptance 2024

been identified a transgender  despite claim online Houston Police officer watch over displaced churchgoer outside Lakewood Church  Sunday  Feb  11  2024  in Houston  after a reported shooting during a Spanish church service  Social medium user are falsely claiming that the shooter ha been identified a transgender   Karen Warren Houston Chronicle via AP  By MELISSA GOLDIN Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print CLAIM  The shooter who carried out an attack injuring two people at a Texas megachurch on Sunday ha been identified a transgender AP S ASSESSMENT  False  Houston police said on Monday that it investigation ha thus far determined that the shooter  Genesse Ivonne Moreno  identified a female despite using multiple alias  including the name Jeffery   or Jeffrey   Escalante  Multiple court record identify Moreno a female  most recently in 2022 THE FACTS  Amid the aftermath of Sunday s shooting at Lakewood Church  which is led by televangelist pastor Joel Osteen  social medium user spread false claim about Moreno s gender identity   BREAKING  Lakewood Church shooter identified a transgender  legal name Genesse Moreno but went by the name  Jeffrey    read one post on X  formerly Twitter  that had received approximately 9 100 like and 6 100 share a of Tuesday  READ MORE NOT REAL NEWS  A look at what didn t happen this week Posts share erroneous information about suspect identification in Kansas City mass shooting Tucker Carlson wa not put on a  kill list  in Ukraine for Putin interview Others claimed that Moreno  who wa fatally shot in an exchange of gunfire  had been born a Jeffery  but went by Genesse a part of her transition  Officials have not found any evidence that Moreno wa transgender  Police said she used male and female alias  but that investigator who looked at past police report determined she identified a female  We do have report she used multiple alias  including Jeffery Escalante   Houston Police Commander Chris Hassig said about 19 minute into a press conference on Monday   So she ha utilized both male and female name  but through all of our investigation to this point  talking with individual  interview  document  Houston Police Department report  she ha been identified this entire time a female  she  her  And so we are identifying her a Genesse Moreno  Hispanic female Records in Harris County  where Houston is located  show that Moreno  under the name Jeffery G  Escalante Moreno or Jeffery G  Escalante  wa charged in six criminal case from 2005 to 2011  She is identified a female in all of them  A case filed in nearby Katy County after Moreno s latest arrest in April 2022 also list her a female  but with the name Genesse Ivonne Moreno  William Capasso  an attorney in Houston who represented Moreno for a portion of her divorce proceeding in 2021 to 2022  told The Associated Press that she went by Jeffrey Moreno Carranza at the time  He said Carranza wa her married name and noted that at that time  there wa no indication that she wa transgender   It is my understanding that although her birth name wa Jeffrey Moreno  she wa born female and identified a a female   he wrote in an email   She did use Genesse and may have changed her name to Genesse Moreno after I represented her  Capasso added that Moreno used the name  Jeffrey Genesse Escalante Moreno  on her son s birth certificate  He said he withdrew a Moreno s attorney in the proceeding because he wa not able to communicate with her effectively Many social medium post used claim about Moreno s gender identity to advance a baseless narrative that there ha been a rise in transgender or nonbinary mass shooter in recent year  This narrative previously spread widely in March 2023  after an assailant who identified a transgender killed six people at a Nashville private school Gender and criminology expert told The Associated Press at the time that mass casualty shooting perpetrated by someone identifying a transgender or nonbinary are rare and that those group are far more likely to be the victim of violence Authorities said on Monday that Moreno used a legally purchased AR 15 style rifle to carry out the attack at Lakewood Church  one of the biggest megachurches in the U S  She wa shot and killed by two off duty officer working security at the building  Two other people were shot and

to 2011  She is identified a female in all of them THE FACTS  Amid the aftermath of Sunday s shooting at Lakewood Church  which is led by televangelist pastor Joel Osteen  social medium user spread false claim about Moreno s gender identity   BREAKING  Lakewood Church shooter identified a transgender  legal name Genesse Moreno but went by the name  Jeffrey    read one post on X  formerly Twitter  that had received approximately 9 100 like and 6 100 share a of Tuesday  Others claimed that Moreno  who wa fatally shot in an exchange of gunfire  had been born a Jeffery  but went by Genesse a part of her transition  Officials have not found any evidence that Moreno wa transgender  Police said she used male and female alias  but that investigator who looked at past police report determined she identified a female   We do have report she used multiple alias  including Jeffery Escalante   Houston Police Commander Chris Hassig said about 19 minute into a press conference on Monday   So she ha utilized both male and female name  but through all of our investigation to this point  talking with individual  interview  document  Houston Police Department report  she ha been identified this entire time a female  she  her  And so we are identifying her a Genesse Moreno  Hispanic female  Records in Harris County  where Houston is located  show that Moreno  under the name Jeffery G  Escalante Moreno or Jeffery G  Escalante  wa charged in six criminal case from 2005 to 2011  She is identified a female in all of them  A case filed in nearby Katy County after Moreno s latest arrest in April 2022 also list her a female  but with the name Genesse Ivonne Moreno  William Capasso  an attorney in Houston who represented Moreno for a portion of her divorce proceeding in 2021 to 2022  told The Associated Press that she went by Jeffrey Moreno Carranza at the time  He said Carranza wa her married name and noted that at that time  there wa no indication that she wa transgender    It is my understanding that although her birth name wa Jeffrey Moreno  she wa born female and identified a a female   he wrote in an email   She did use Genesse and may have changed her name to Genesse Moreno after I represented her   Capasso added that Moreno used the name  Jeffrey Genesse Escalante Moreno  on her son s birth certificate  He said he withdrew a Moreno s attorney in the proceeding because he wa not able to communicate with her effectively  Many social medium post used claim about Moreno s gender identity to advance a baseless narrative that there ha been a rise in transgender or nonbinary mass shooter in recent year  This narrative previously spread widely in March 2023  after an assailant who identified a transgender killed six people at a Nashville private school  Gender and criminology expert told The Associated Press at the time that mass casualty shooting perpetrated by someone identifying a transgender or nonbinary are rare and that those group are far more likely to be the victim of violence  Authorities said on Monday that Moreno used a legally purchased AR 15 style rifle to carry out the attack at Lakewood Church  one of the biggest megachurches in the U S  She wa shot and killed by two off duty officer working security at the building  Two other people were shot and wounded  including Moreno s young son  who she brought with her to the church  Spectrum

new Trevor Project report detail the challenge faced by Black LGBTQ  young people and how they differ within this population Trudy RingFebruary 13 2024 12 44 PM ESTFebruary 13 2024 12 44 PM ESTtrudestressBlack LGBTQ  young people are experiencing high rate of discrimination and victimization   and with that come a high suicide risk  especially among transgender  nonbinary  and questioning Black youth  say a new report from the Trevor Project Twenty one percent of Black trans  nonbinary  and questioning young people reported a suicide attempt in the past year  note the Trevor Project s research brief  titled  Discrimination Among Black LGBTQ  Young People and Suicide Risk   released Tuesday and based on data collected through the Trevor Project s 2023 U S  National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ Young People  That compare to just 8 percent of Black cisgender LGBQ youth The difference is  not surprising  but  telling   say Derrick Matthews  director of research science at the Trevor Project and lead author of the brief  No single factor or experience definitively cause someone to have higher odds of considering or attempting suicide   he tell The Advocate via email   However  these data show that experience of gender discrimination were associated with higher odds of suicide risk for Black transgender  nonbinary  and questioning young people  Intersecting identity are imperative to analyze when we talk about experience of discrimination because  simply put  the more marginalized identity a person hold  the more opportunity they have to be discriminated against   This signal a greater need for ally  advocate  family  and friend to better support and affirm the gender expansive Black LGBTQ  young people in their life   in a way that may vary from how we might show up for cisgender Black LGBQ youth   Matthews note Demonstrating the pervasiveness of discrimination  70 percent of Black ci LGBQ youth reported experiencing discrimination based on their race  sexual orientation  or gender identity or expression in the past year  while the proportion wa even greater   83 percent   among Black trans  nonbinary  or questioning youth  The majority reported experiencing two or more form of discrimination  Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity or expression were both associated with a heightened risk of suicide  But many who d experienced this discrimination also reported receiving support from someone in their life  such a a friend  a romantic partner  a therapist  or a sibling Shutterstock Although these result can be dispiriting  we encourage all LGBTQ  youth facing people to use these finding to bolster effort to both end discrimination and address it effect head on   the report say   Black LGBTQ  young people themselves have not only acknowledged the role of intersectional discrimination in their own life  but have shaped their activism to be intersectional to combat it a well  Adults working with Black LBGTQ  young people should ensure that they are prepared to support all aspect of Black LGBTQ  young people s identity a they navigate the combined effect of racism  anti LGBTQ bigotry  and other form of bias   While there will always be a role for providing service to help Black LGBTQ  young people cope with the effect of living in a discriminatory social environment  we must also not lose sight that the goal must always be to reduce exposure to discrimination in the first place   the brief continues   We should celebrate the resilience of Black LGBTQ  young people for thriving  but that cannot absolve u of a collective responsibility to move closer to a world where that resilience is not a necessary part of survival  Matthews noted that Black LGBTQ  young people aren t inherently proned to a higher risk of suicide   Rather  they are placed at higher risk because of how they are mistreated and stigmatized by others   he explained   These finding are difficult  But they should serve a a call to action for ally  advocate  youth serving professional  and adult everywhere  It s time to step up our effort to let Black trans and nonbinary young people know that we are here for them by working to reduce their experience of discrimination   and reminding them that this world really is a better place because they are in it  If you are having thought of suicide or

108,Greece brink legalising sex marriage,A bill would allow gay couple to marry and adopt  but it face opposition from the Orthodox Church ,Center,High Factuality,Government of the United Kingdom,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68274008?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral,Government,brink of legalising same sex marriagePublished3 day agoShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage caption  Christina and Victoria say legalising same sex marriage would be a big step for GreeceBy Mark LowenSouthern Europe Correspondent  AthensIn her garden in northern Athens  four year old Niovi play make believe  selling cake from her imaginary shop  For her two mum  Christina Leimoni and Victoria Kalfaki  their dream may soon become real  a Greece stand on the brink of legalising same sex marriage Parliament will vote on the bill  introduced by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis  on Thursday  Facing dissent from member of his own centre right party  he will need to rely on support from the left wing opposition to get it through Christina and Victoria will be there inside the chamber  willing it to pas  Two year ago  they returned to Greece from the UK  where they had moved for work   and to live their relationship freely They married in the UK and Niovi wa born there  If the law pass  they plan to have their marriage recognised under Greek law  I have no say After Niovi s birth in London  they tried to register her at the Greek embassy  but were rebuffed   The commentary wa   You should have thought before having her    Christina recall  It wa awful  I cried in the car for 45 minute  I couldn t stop   it still brings bad memory   Victoria say  welling up with tear   It s like being rejected by your country  Image caption  Niovi wa born in the UK and is now four year oldWithout legal recognition for their marriage in Greece  only Victoria  who gave birth to Niovi  is accepted a her mother  even though the egg wa from Christina At school  she ha no say over decision and when Niovi ha been admitted to hospital  Christina ha been barred from entering her room  My biggest fear is that if anything really bad happens to Victoria and she dy  our child instantly go to social service  who then see if any of Victoria s relative want to adopt her   she say  If they don t  she go into an institution  I have no say  So the child wouldn t just lose one mother  she d lose both of u  Opposition by the ChurchFifteen of the European Union s 27 member have already legalised same sex marriage  It is permitted in 35 country worldwide  Greece ha lagged behind European neighbour largely because of opposition from it powerful church  If the law pass this week  it would become the first Christian Orthodox majority country  and the first in Europe s southeast  to have marriage equality Same sex couple would also be legally allowed to adopt child but not to have a baby through a surrogate   a recourse that is only legal here for heterosexual couple who have a medical need for assisted reproduction  Greece geographically is in the southeast  but culturally and politically it belongs to the West   say Alex Patelis  the prime minister s chief economic advisor and a member of the committee that drafted the marriage bill Image caption  Equal right fit the centre right government s ideology  say PM s advisor Alex PatelisMr Mitsotakis  recently storming to re election  face a weak opposition that ha left him the space to tread onto their political turf without jeopardising his own position Mr Patelis say the bill is a cornerstone of the prime minister s belief   It s often thought that human right and equality are the purview of the party of the left  This is coming from a centre right party   and it s important to recognise that equality under law and individual right are also the ideology of the right  But Greek society is split  A recent poll for Proto Thema newspaper found 55  in favour of same sex marriage and an even slimmer majority backing adoption Up to 50 of Mr Mitsotakis s 158 MPs are expected either to vote against the bill or to be conveniently absent from the chamber  meaning they can duck the vote A letter by the Church of Greece opposing the move wa read out in morning mass across the country earlier this month  condemning what it said would  promote the abolition of fatherhood and motherhood  and put the sexual choice of homosexual adult above the interest of future child  Image caption  Greece s powerful Orthodox Church ha galvanised protest against same sex marriageOne of the most outspoken prelate ha been Bishop Seraphim of Piraeus  At the city s Agii Anargiri Church  we watch a he lead a packed service  with worshipper in their Sunday best kissing icon and bowing head He recently warned that he would block MPs who back the bill from his church  adding it would be preferable if they had not been born  And  he said  he would refuse to baptise child of same sex couple  to help them understand that what their guardian are doing is a sin  Outside parliament on Syntagma Square  opponent gather to protest against the bill  beneath banner reading  No child for pervert  and chanting  Take your hand off our kid  A video show image including religious icon and  oddly  Bill Gates  Conspiracy theory about a new global order being imposed on Greece have blended with pious Greeks who believe their tradition are being destroyed  The Bible say

follows decade of struggle By Associated Press Published February 12  2024 10 01 PM Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on Linkedin By DEREK GATOPOULOS Associated Press ATHENS  Greece  AP    Years before starting a family of her own  Stella Belia wa already waging a tireless campaign for legal recognition  Her fight may finally be over this week   a few month shy of her twin boy  17th birthday  Greek lawmaker are expected to legalize same sex marriage in a parliament vote Thursday  with a rare display of cross party collaboration  Approval would make Greece the first Orthodox Christian country to take that step  clearing multiple legal hurdle for gay couple who already have or want to have child   I ve been fighting for this ever since I figured out who I wa   say Belia  a 57 year old drama teacher with a gruff voice and an easy laugh   And it s a great relief to say we ve finally made it   she said   But it is tiresome  very tiresome to fight for something that s an obvious right   to suffer for something that other people are just handed   and have to fight so hard to get it   Belia split with her female partner when her son were aged 11 but she considers her to be the boy  other mother  Although civil partnership were extended to gay couple in Greece nearly a decade ago  only the biological parent of child in those relationship are currently recognized a legal guardian  The issue of child s right  including the publicized plight of cancer survivor in a same sex relationship  helped nudge public opinion toward narrowly favoring the bill that wa sponsored by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis  conservative government  But it also triggered a strong reaction from the country s Orthodox Church  Representing Greece s dominant faith  the Church argues the marriage bill would confuse parental role and weaken the traditional family  The Church petitioned lawmaker to reconsider in a public appeal also read out at Sunday service  Several prominent bishop have taken a tougher line  warning that they will refuse to baptize the child of gay couple  They allied with far right political party and traditionalist group to stage public demonstration  Protester Chara Giannakantonaki said she felt compelled to attend a rally held in front of parliament last Sunday   Every minority already ha it right guaranteed  There is no issue  They don t need  same sex  marriage  They just want to desecrate whatever ha remained sacred in Greece  Our Church  our family and our child   she said   But child are a red line and we will never accept this   The Mitsotakis government is facing dissent among conservative over the bill and will need support from the centrist and left wing opposition to secure the 151 vote minimum in the 300 member parliament  Dimitris Mavros  managing director of the market research firm MRB Hellas  said the timing of the bill appeared to be carefully calculated  Backing a measure that prop up Mitsotakis  centrist credential but with the controversy likely to blow over before the European Union wide election in June  Greeks in 2024  Mavros said  have shown a sharp rise in financial anxiety  their worry reflected in recent strike and ongoing farmer  protest   I think the farmer   protest  and high price   and issue that hurt people s pocket   are going to overshadow the same sex couple issue   he said   We re probably going to get past this calmly   Chrysa Gkotsopoulou and Elena Kotsifi  both engineer  for year told their family and colleague they were roommate and only came out a a couple after moving to England for work in 2015  They now have a young daughter  Ariadne  and all three travel to Greece using their U K  passport   We quickly realized that England offered u prospect a a couple that we had never previously imagined   Kotsifi  38  said   We could be ourselves   They flew to Athens at the weekend to celebrate the bill s expected approval  and said that for the first time in nearly a decade  they now view returning home a a possibility  They hope to join the activist Belia and others Thursday night in the public gallery in parliament and celebration set to follow   If there s room for u  in parliament   we d like to go   Gkotsopoulou said   We feel joy  joy and pride that Greece is moving to the right side of history   Article Topic Follows  AP National Jump to

finding reveal a disturbing increase in violence against transgender individual  spotlighting the South s lax gun law and discriminatory policy Christopher WigginsFebruary 13 2024 8 00 AM ESTFebruary 13 2024 8 49 AM ESTCwnewserIn a revealing new report by Everytown for Gun Safety  a disturbing trend ha been highlighted  showcasing a rise in homicide of transgender people across the United States  with a troubling concentration in the Southern state  This comprehensive analysis  running from 2017 through 2023  shed light on the urgent need for awareness and action against the violence that disproportionately affect the transgender community Keep up with the latest in LGBTQ  news and politics  Sign up for The Advocate s email newsletter In an in depth interview with The Advocate  Sarah Burd Sharps  senior director of research at Everytown for Gun Safety  shared insight into the finding and the pressing implication of this data  She emphasized the dire connection between firearm and the murder of transgender people amid a challenging landscape where a lot of data wasn t readily available  We started tracking the homicide of transgender and gender expansive people in 2017 because there wa very little understanding of the link between gun violence and violence against the transgender community   Burd Sharps said The report document 263 homicide over the seven year  with an alarming increase in incident  particularly in 2023  With approximately three quarter of these homicide involving a gun  the report underscore the critical nature of addressing gun violence a a key factor in these tragic death  A stark revelation from the study is the disproportionate impact on Black transgender woman  who represent a substantial majority of the victim  further magnified by the prevalence of firearm use in these crime Related  Trans People Continue to Be Murdered at Extreme Rates a Republicans Push Transphobic LawsBurd Sharps pointed out the correlation between the surge in anti transgender sentiment  particularly in the South  and the rising instance of violence  Nearly half of these incident involving gun are in the south  in southern state   she said  explaining that trans people in the South face specific danger She attributed this trend to a combination of lax gun law and discriminatory legislation  Burd Sharps drew a direct line between policy decision and the safety of marginalized community  suggesting that legislative action   or inaction   ha real  tangible consequence for the life of transgender individual  It s a combination of weak legislation on hate crime and the kind of new  anti LGBTQ   legislation that state government are considering and passing that target transgender people for unequal treatment   Burd Sharps said  She called for stronger legislative action across the country  advocating for the enactment of hate crime misdemeanor prohibitors and extreme risk  or red flag  law a critical step toward mitigating this violence  Such measure would significantly impact the safety of transgender individual by restricting access to firearm for those with hate crime conviction and allowing for the temporary removal of gun from individual posing a threat to themselves or others  she said This toxic mix of discriminatory law and lax gun regulation creates a perilous environment for transgender individual  particularly in state like Texas  which lack prohibition against firearm possession for individual with hate crime conviction  If Texas would adopt a hate crime misdemeanor prohibitor  like half of U S  state  it would right away make a difference   Burd Sharps explained  Such legal measure would prevent individual convicted of hate crime from legally owning firearm  a step she view a crucial for reducing violence against transgender people Related  Gun violence  is always going to sit with me   Grief  trauma  and the rising threat of firearm in AmericaAddressing the broader societal implication  Burd Sharps urged a collective understanding and response to gun violence  emphasizing that it affect entire community  not just the transgender population   Hate crime and hateful action in our community  no matter who it s against  affect all of u   she said  calling for a united front to protect vulnerable group and foster a safer environment for everyone The conversation also explored the broader social implication of transgender homicide  with Burd Sharps emphasizing the role of stigma and discrimination in pushing transgender individual to the margin of society  This marginalization  she noted  often force transgender people into vulnerable situation that increase their risk of becoming victim of violence   One of the root cause is the challenge to finding employment  the challenge to being discriminated against  push you towards occupation that can expose you to more risk and higher rate of crime   she said These social determinant of health and safety  combined with legislative hostility  create a precarious existence for many transgender people Burd Sharps said transgender homicide should matter to everyone  not just those within the LGBTQ  community  She framed this violence a an issue that impact entire community   We live in community  we live in neighborhood  and I m not just saying that you could take a bullet because you happen to be in proximity of it  but you are part of a community where these crime are occurring   she said From Your Site Articles3 transgender people were slain in just two week  The community want answer  These Are the Trans People

shooter wa armed with an AR 15 and a 22 caliber rifle  police official said  She had a long gun  and it could ve been a lot worse   Finner remarked  The chief also addressed the critical condition of the injured child  emphasizing the shooter s responsibility for endangering the child if the police gunfire had led to his injury  It s unclear who shot the child Whitmire focused on reassurance and the ongoing priority of public safety  stating   It is our highest priority to have total transparency   and emphasizing the city s dedication to addressing mental health issue and ensuring the safety of all place of worship Commander Christopher Hassig of HPD s homicide division clarified the shooter s identity  Our shooter is identified by a driver s license a Genesee Moreno  36 year old

It s the biological mother   referring to the critically injured 7 year old boy who wa shot in the head The incident ha also been a magnet for misinformation  notably propagated by far right figure on social medium  U S  Rep  Marjorie Taylor Greene  a Republican from Georgia  contributed to the confusion with a post on X  formerly Twitter  making unfounded claim about the shooter s identity and motivation   Not only wa the shooter a trans from El Salvador  she also had a gun engraved with  Free Palestine   but investigator can t say if she wa politically motivated or not  When this country start being truthful  regardless of who s feeling get hurt  we will solve many problem   Greene wrote  casting aspersion without evidence        Hassig disclosed that the buttstock of the AR 15 the shooter used had a single sticker that read  Palestine         Chaya Raichik of Libs of TikTok further fueled the misinformation  erroneously writing   BREAKING  The Lakewood Church shooter wa transgender  He went by the name  Genesse  and previously  Jeffrey   Another act of trans terrorism  We need to have a national conversation about the LGBTQ movement turning youth into violent extremist   based solely on the suspect s criminal history listing a male name a an alias  There are some discrepancy   Hassig said  noting   We do have report she used multiple alias  including Jeffrey Escalante   but that based on police record and interview  the shooter wa identified a female throughout        Republican Missouri U S  Senator Josh Hawley also perpetuated the falsehood that the shooter wa trans  So the Lakewood church shooter wa a transgender  pro Palestine radical  We need a full hate crime investigation  including the influence on the shooter s motivation  plan   thinking   he wrote According to a Reuters fact check  the vast majority of mass shooter are cisgender white men So the Lakewood church shooter wa a transgender  pro Palestine radical  We need a full hate crime investigation  including the influence on the shooter u2019s motivation  plan   thinking  n nhttps   t co TwFlaQcRfe       Fox News also ran a false story with the headline   Lakewood church shooting suspect identified a transgender woman   Free Palestine  written on gun   before changing it  without adding an editor s note  to  Lakewood church shooter identified a Genesse Ivonne Moreno   Palstine  written on gun   The article s author did insert within the body of the piece a sentence that claimed that  Preliminary reporting indicated the shooter wa transgender   which is also false Oh no you don t Fox News  you don t get to make incendiary claim without evidence and then stealth edit your article without a full retraction and correction        In response to these misleading narrative  Alejandra Caraballo  a transgender attorney and Harvard Law School instructor  criticized the rush to spread falsehood She wrote   Far right extremist account like Libs of Tiktok rushed to call the shooter at Joel Osteen s church a transgender woman  The police have just confirmed that is not the case and she wa the biological mother of the child who wa shot  They won t apologize or retract their lie  GLAAD s president and CEO Sara Kate Ellis told The Advocate in a statement   It is unbelievably tragic and unfortunately all too predictable to see another community reeling from gun violence  and social medium extremist trying to dictate coverage with repulsive and irresponsible lie  Smearing transgender people is inaccurate and harmful  and it distracts from what should be the focus in every mass shooting  the pain in shattered community  how gun violence is the number one killer of child  and how easy access to weapon of war continues to endanger every community  She added   Social medium extremist who ob over transgender people and new way to target them are not assignment editor  They are extremist whose disinformation campaign lead to bomb threat against child s hospital  elementary school  library and church  Their lie are dangerous and have consequence  Every reporter and voter must ask their local leader what they are doing to end gun violence  Every American must reject rhetoric from politician and extremist medium that prioritizes unhinged obsession over public safety  From Your Site ArticlesRight wing influencers seem happy that

Family,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/oklahoma-principal-drag-queen-resigns-ryan-walters-pressure-rcna138132?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral,Individual,drag queen side gig resigns under pressure from Oklahoma school officialState Superintendent Ryan Walters is calling for a regulation that would allow educator to be fired for  act that excessively promote sexuality  outside of work Shane Murnan  principal at John Glenn Elementary School in Oklahoma  say he wa forced out of his job because of his side gig a a drag performer Courtesy Shane MurnanPrintFeb  13  2024  2 29 AM UTCBy Tyler KingkadeFor two decade  Shane Murnan worked a an educator by day and a drag queen on night and weekend at club in Oklahoma City  He won award for his performance a he moved up in his career to become an administrator  He never had a problem with his dual identity  he said  until last year At the start of the fall 2023 semester  a Murnan started a new job a principal of John Glenn Elementary School in the Western Heights School District  an anonymous newsletter posted about his drag persona and past criminal charge he had faced  Two day later  on Aug  31  the far right social medium account Libs of TikTok posted about Murnan  and Ryan Walters  the incendiary state superintendent  called for him to be fired  Soon after  the district and Murnan received bomb threat  according to police record and interview Now Murnan is leaving his job  while Walters try to enact rule to make it easier to fire educator who perform in drag outside of their job  Murnan said he most likely won t work for another school district in Oklahoma after this experience  I m a very professional person   I ve worked really hard   Murnan said in an interview   I ve gone to school  I got my bachelor s  my master s  my doctorate   I have been devoted to education  trying to make it a better thing  But they ve destroyed me  and I don t know where I m going or what I m doing now  This ha been a nightmare  The Western Heights School Board voted Monday to accept Murnan s resignation at it regular monthly meeting  Murnan said district administrator had not allowed him to work in the John Glenn Elementary School building during the school day since September because they said it wa a safety risk  While Western Heights Superintendent Brayden Savage initially backed Murnan  he said  she told him last month that if he didn t resign  the district would terminate him because of the cost of increased security  The district asked him to sign an agreement that included a clause preventing him from talking publicly about the controversy  Murnan said  but he refused  Savage didn t respond to a request for comment  Murnan is the latest example of an educator singled out by Walters over ideological disagreement  Walters accused a teacher in 2022 of promoting pornography by sharing a QR code to access book from the Brooklyn Public Library  the teacher quit and moved out of the state a Walters moved to revoke her teaching license  Last August  Walters promoted a Libs of TikTok post about an Oklahoma school librarian   who said her  radical liberal agenda is teaching kid to love book and be kind    and suggested it showed a  woke ideology   the librarian s district for several day received bomb threat  which were deemed not credible Ryan Walters  Oklahoma s school superintendent  warned that people who hired Shane Murnan will be  held accountable  Christopher Creese for NBC NewsReacting to earlier report about Murnan s exit  Walters posted a video on Feb  2 calling his resignation  a big win for Oklahoma school   He promised that people who hired him  will be held accountable   The Oklahoma Education Department declined to answer several question regarding Walters  statement about Murnan and Western Heights  but Walters said in a statement he ha  proposed the most aggressive model in the nation for identifying and uprooting these folk from our school  Walters recently proposed a regulation that would allow educator to be fired for  act that excessively promote sexuality  outside of work  in the presence of a minor or in a manner available to a minor online   He ha said the proposed rule  which is still being considered by the state agency  is an attempt to prevent others who perform in drag from holding position a teacher or administrator  and the department ha stated it assumes such educator are  likely to behave inappropriately in the presence of minor in a classroom  The anonymous newsletter that first called attention to Murnan  called V1SUT  ha also frequently focused on decade old criminal charge against Murnan that were dropped Murnan wa charged with possession of child sexual abuse material in 2001  when he wa a fifth grade teacher  Two judge dismissed the charge  ruling that prosecutor couldn t prove the allegation  and the case were expunged  Murnan contends a former colleague fabricated the allegation Before Western Heights hired him a a principal  Murnan passed a background check  and the district said it wa aware of his past court case  The district ha said he came highly recommended  and it noted his teaching certificate had recently been reissued to him  signed by Walters  Community member rallied in September to defend Murnan  They showed up at the school board meeting with shirt reading   StandWithMurnan   Murnan said he didn t hide his side gig a a drag queen  but he also didn t boast about it at school  There s never been an issue  because I ve never put it out there to make it an issue   he said   I did my side job on the weekend  and then I went to work and worked my tail off to make the school a better place  They never conflicted with each other  Then someone took it and ran with it and tried to make it into a spectacle that it s not  Savage  the district superintendent  told John Glenn Elementary School staff member at a Dec  15 meeting that she had defended Murnan  according to video of the meeting obtained by NBC News  However  Savage told the employee that Murnan wouldn t return to the elementary school campus because she and the district were still receiving hate mail and threat  I m not caving to Ryan Walters   Savage told the staff   but I have to ultimately keep the student and the staff of this school safe  The hate ha not stopped  To bring Shane back to the building is a risk to safety for all  I cannot be totally sure that one of those crazy will not show up to  quote unquote  cleanse the building  which is something I ve seen over and over again  In January  Murnan said  the district unexpectedly put him on administrative leave  Savage then asked him to resign  citing the expense of extra security  Murnan said  Savage told The Oklahoman the district had spent about  65 000 since August on additional security  administrative help  and other cost  Murnan said he signed a resignation letter on Jan  26  Murnan said his ouster raise question about the state education department s focus  Right now  it s not about the kid in

certificate and government collection of data The bill ha drawn widespread condemnation from LGBTQ  right advocacy group  who branded it a  erasure  of transgender and nonbinary people and a violation of privacy Republicans fast tracked Reynolds  proposal last week  advancing it through subcommittee and committee hearing over the course of an afternoon over the objection of Democrats and advocate More Iowa Gov  Kim Reynolds  bill defining a  man  and a  woman   explained in 75 secondsHeated testimony at hearing come amid raucous chant outsideReynolds ha described the legislation a a  woman s bill of right   while opponent say it would not only harm LGBTQ Iowans but could impact other service  like aid for sexual assault and domestic abuse victim Denise Bubeck  deputy director of The Family Leader s Church Ambassador Network  said she wa thankful that Reynolds brought the bill forward  It is legislation based on biological truth   she said   Actually  none of u would be here today if it wasn t for biology  God created woman and man  Period  Max Mowitz described themselves a a proud Iowan  The legislation will likely cause many LGBTQ Iowans to leave the state  Mowitz said   but I cannot bring myself to do the same   Being an Iowan is just a important to me a being trans   Mowitz said   This is my state  too  Every time I come to this Capitol  I am reminded of how much I love a state that doe not love me back  The atmosphere in the room grew tense at time  with one speaker describing transgender woman in woman s bathroom a engaging in  domestic terrorism  and another likening being transgender to joining a cult Rep  Skyler Wheeler  R Hull  who ran the hearing  stopped the speaker several time throughout the night a chant of  you will not erase u  echoed through the frosted glass door of the committee room  We re going to hold off until that stop   he said at one point   I know when you re in here you can probably hear fine  but a I said earlier we re not going to have a heckler s veto  Acting on signal from those standing just outside the committee room s door  the crowd began chanting while proponent of the legislation spoke inside When the crowd got word that Wheeler wa pausing  they initially quieted down before breaking into another chant in response   we won t play your game  that s not why we came  During the hearing  others gathered in the hallway strained to hear testimony  holding their phone to their ear with a live stream pulled up  When it came to a close  chant were amplified a the room emptied and some of those who were in the room joined the rotunda crowd  We ll keep showing up   they chanted before dispersing  also shouting expletive directed at Reynolds Berry Stevens  a genderfluid 13 year old  said the law attempt to write them out of existence and would endanger LGBTQ Iowans  Because you seem to need a reminder  gender is how we present ourselves to the world and sex is based on anatomical genetic and chromosomal detail   Stevens said   You can know my gender based on how I present and introduce myself  however you can t know my sex without accessing my medical record  genetic testing or you being a creep  Josh Briggs  a father of four girl  said it wa  ridiculous  that the legislation wa needed  But he said opponent of the bill  forced the need for this legislation through their totalitarian tactic   It doe not take a biologist to understand that male and female are different  not just in sexual organ  but size  shape  respiratory system  skin  hair  nervous system  brain  sensory immune system  tissue   he said   The science is truly clear  More What you should know about the Iowa bill that legally defines  man    woman  and  sex Reynolds  bill would define sex  female  male  woman  girl  man  boy  father and mother in state law  and require new birth certificate for transgender Iowans to include the sex assigned at birth and current identity  after the state registrar receives a notarized affidavit from a licensed physician or surgeon stating the reason for surgery and the person s changed sex designation During committee  Republicans amended the bill to remove language that would require transgender Iowans to get a new marking on their driver s license to identify their sex assigned at birth and current identity Several speaker took issue with a line in the bill that say   equal  doe not mean  same  or  identical    and that  separate accommodation are not inherently unequal   I am confused why we are here discussing the concept of separate but equal and how our governor belief this bill is constitutional we all know separate but equal is inherently unconstitutional   said Annie Sarcone  director of the Des Moines Queer Youth Resource Center Geralyn Jones  a mother from Linn County  said it s simple to define a woman s biological makeup  I find it insulting that we have legislator and school board member and others in position of authority that find it challenging to define what a female is   she said   That s unacceptable  You re supposed to be standing on truth  Galen Bacharier cover politics for the Register  Reach him at gbacharier registermedia

45 pm Eastern  During a Monday afternoon press conference  Christopher Hassig  commander of the HPD homicide unit  addressed the confusion regarding the shooter s identity  specifically gender  Per Hassig  Advertisement  Our shooter is identified by a driver s license a Genesse Moreno  36 year old  Hispanic female  There are some discrepancy   we do have report she used multiple alias  including  Jeffrey Escalante   so she ha utilized both male and female name  But through all of our investigation to this point  talking with individual  interview  document  Houston Police Department report she ha been identified this entire time a female   she her  And so we are identifying her a Genesse Moreno  Hispanic female  The child ha been identified a Moreno s seven year old biological son  He sustained one gunshot wound to the head and is in critical condition Additionally  authority provided some clarification regarding the reported writing sticker on the weapon  Authorities stated that the buttstock of the AR 15 she wielded featured a sticker of the word  Palestine   Previous report incorrectly stated the long gun featured the word  Free Palestine   Hassig stated  antisemitic writing  have been discovered in subsequent investigation into Genesse Authorities also provided some additional background that may point to a potential motive Hassig also stated the shooter had a history of mental health illness and wa previously put under emergency detention order by Houston police  Genesse appears to have legally purchased at least one of the gun used in the attack a recently a December  The commander stated the shooter may have been embroiled in a familial dispute with the family of an ex husband  We do believe there wa a familial dispute between her and her ex husband s family  and some of those people are Jewish   Hassig said  Advertisement Original StorySunday  36 year old Genesse Ivonne Moreno  accompanied by a five year old child  walked into Joel

hospitalized ALERT  Houston Police Confirm Shooter Dead  2 Injured After Gunfire at Osteen Church During ServiceA larger tragedy wa avoided by Lakewood Church having armed security guard who were doing their job diligently and a plan for the possibility of an active shooter As the fact dripped out  it became evident that this shooting would be quickly memory holed  The shooter wa a  transwoman  whose real name wa Jeffrey Escalante  Escalante wa from El Salvador  but there is no word on his immigration status  Per law enforcement record  Moreno also had identified a Jeffery Escalante in the past  and had prior arrest for assault  forgery  marijuana possession  theft  evading  and unlawful carrying weapon  Jeremy Rogalski   JRogalskiKHOU  February 12  2024The AR 15 he carried had  Free

transgenders and their supporter We need to wake up to what is going on  People already suffering from a mental disorder and who may be on a hormonal drug regimen are becoming radicalized and encouraged to use violence to address their grievance with the rest of the world  The political side of the transgender movement is not benign  that movement openly promotes violence  and until it is

Photo via  McCracken County Jail   Kentucky  OAN s Brooke Mallory3 29 PM   Thursday  February 8  2024 A biological man that now identifies a a transgender woman who wa accused of sexually assaulting an infant entered into a plea agreement  and if he continues to comply with the term of the agreement  will not go to prison in Kentucky  Advertisement Former childcare worker  Maria Childers  enlisted the help of a well known trans activist attorney to defend him in the horrifying case  Following an anonymous complaint to the Department of Community Based Services  DCBS  regarding purported abuse at Explore Learning Academy that wa first reported in November 2022  Childers wa finally placed under arrest in February 2023 after a thorough investigation  According to the tip  which wa allegedly submitted by one of Childers  coworkers  he wa accused of inappropriately touching the baby s private part and making inappropriate comment while it wa being changed on a changing table  Now that the press ha been given access to the complete complaint against Childers this week  it show that he wa accused of both physical and sexual abuse during his tenure working at the daycare facility  On February 8th  2023  a DCBS case worker and a Paducah Police Department officer visited the daycare to speak with witness after receiving the first anonymous complaint  They were then able to verify the anonymous allegation by chatting with numerous employee who had also witnessed Childers  disturbing behavior  Witness testimony said that Childers wa asked to help a coworker change an infant s diaper  The coworker noted that the baby seemed distressed a Childers wa cleaning the baby s genitalia and inquired a to whether Childers wa injuring the child  She then saw Childers  circularly  stroke the baby s genitalia  stating   That wa her clit area  and she like it  It just made her day   However  Childers only received a  write up  from Academy management despite being reported  Subsequently  the police discovered that Childers had also been accused by other colleague of neglecting the kid in high chair for  hour   Upon being brought to the police station for interrogation  Childers first claimed that he had not changed the baby s diaper whatsoever  Nevertheless  after an officer showed him a text message that he had sent to the director of the daycare verifying the baby s diaper change  he subsequently acknowledged having done so  Later  Childers attempted to refute any inappropriate remark that he had made and maintained that he frequently made statement that were  taken out of context   in his own word  Soon after  Childers wa taken into custody and charged with three count of first degree criminal abuse of a child under the age of twelve and one count of first degree sexual abuse of a victim under the age of twelve  The McCracken County Jail then received a booking for him  His last name ha been spelled differently by the court  the police  and his social medium account  which alternate between the spelling  Childers  and  Childres   This ha caused considerable confusion  His name is written  Childres  in the Kentucky Court of Justice record  while  Childers  appears under his own signature and in his defense file  Although Childers wa first identified a  male  by the police and the jail  internal record that the outlet Reduxx wa able to obtain show that the McCracken County Jail eventually changed Childers  reported sex to  female   Court document also revealed that Childers hired trans activist attorney Madison Leach on a private basis to represent him barely one month after he wa detained  When Leach campaigned a a Democrat for the Calloway County attorney seat  he became the first openly transgender candidate to run for public office in western Kentucky  Leach is a biological man who started identifying a a transgender woman seven year ago  Leach filed a request to lower Childers  bond  claiming that when he wa held in solitary confinement at the McCracken County Jail  he wa  deprived of estrogen   The request wa eventually granted  and Childers  bond wa lowered from  100 000 to  5 000  The bail requirement included staying away from the daycare where he had worked and having no contact with minor  In January 2024  Childers wa freed from detention  Childers seems to have reached an agreement with prosecutor on January 29th  2024  His charge of First Degree Sexual Abuse of a Victim Under 12 wa modified to Class A Misdemeanor Sexual Misconduct in return for a guilty plea  and the other abuse count were shockingly withdrawn  Judge Joseph Roark handed Childers  a 12 month penalty   but deferred sentencing and granted a six month conditional release  Childers may even avoid having a criminal record and avoid doing any prison time a long a he follows the rule established by the court throughout the six month term  Kentucky transgender daycare worker  Maria Childers  will NOT be going to prison despite pleading guilty to sexually abusing a baby while changing it diaper  He hired a trans activist lawyer  who argued that he would not have access to estrogen  and the court agreed  The  pic twitter com jjksake11k  Ian Miles Cheong   stillgray  February 7  2024 Stay informed  Receive breaking news blast directly to your inbox for free  Subscribe here  http   www

Read our privacy noticeAs ridiculous a it sound  and it is  without doubt  an absurd thing to have done   my wife cried when she watched her first Parkrun a few year ago Not at the fast finishing time  although there were a few  not at the mini internal battle silently encouraging runner to eke out that tiny extra burst of effort approaching the finish line  not at the level of competition  which wa so low that it wa almost absent  Simply because she wa overwhelmed by the inclusive nature of a community event that truly embraced everyone A shared activity that welcomed  encouraged and in no way judged  Running for all  old and young  fast and slow  able and barely able but happily willing People running the 5km Parkrun held every Saturday morning in the UK and around the world  Getty Images A couple of week later  she began taking part  sometimes trying to beat her previous best time and on other occasion steadily plodding along while reaping the benefit of the endorphin flooding her mind and body on a collective Saturday morning run  jog or walk  delete a applicable   The tear have ceased but the original sentiment remains  this free  weekly five kilometre event that nine million people have signed up for globally is an overwhelmingly positive thing  right Well  it depends on who you ask  For the past few month  campaigner have been protesting in person and on social medium against Parkrun  threatening to call for taxpayer  money   in the form of funding distributed by Sport England   to be withdrawn  Their issue is the organisation s policy of collecting participant data based on gender identity rather than biological sex  Yes  it s the thorny subject of transgender right and sport Runners taking part in the Bushy Park Parkrun  PA When someone register with Parkrun they are asked their gender and provided four option to choose from  female  male  another gender identity and prefer not to say According to campaigner   including the right leaning think tank Policy Exchange   such a policy allows transgender runner to identify a female  which threatens the sanctity of woman s sport Last December  Policy Exchange released a document supported by a smattering of high profile sportspeople  which found that there have been  at least three verified instance of transgender woman  biological male  competing in the female category and setting new woman s record and distorting female ranking  As an increasingly transphobic culture ha steadily seeped into all aspect of society  so have the protest against Parkrun deepened until  this Thursday  the organisation acted  Amid call to introduce a separate transgender record section in it result  Parkrun instead pulled various metric from it website  including gender  course and age record Some runner complete Parkrun each week while pushing a buggy or alongside their dog  Getty Images Eager to portray itself a a health charity and community event rather than a formal sport or competition  Parkrun suggested the decision wa not a direct response to the transgender issue and wa instead aimed at removing any  disconnect between the performance data displayed so prominently on the site  and our mission to create opportunity for a many people a possible   But do not be mistaken   the record would still be there if these campaign were not ongoing At this point  there is a vital distinction to make  one that could not be of greater importance  Parkrun is not elite sport  Many people enjoy using record a motivation to compete against themselves and others  with their existence solely designed to add interest and widen participation But they do not define Parkrun   an organisation that ha celebrated a steady slowing in average finishing time of participant with each passing year a more people take part In elite or professional sport  a small number of male to female transgender athlete  who posse physical benefit gained from experiencing puberty a a man  have the very real potential to deny cisgender woman their livelihood  take medal and money away from those who were born female  and pose a genuine threat to the entire purpose of woman s sport Runners gather at the start line at Heaton Park  Manchester  Getty Images for The National Lo Those same transgender people taking part in Parkrun hold precisely none of those threat  Nothing is at stake  No money is available to be won  There is no podium  no medal  In the grand scheme of thing  the record that have now been removed were entirely meaningless beyond providing some element of interest to those who might seek them out In the same way that they did not show whether someone ha surgically or otherwise changed their gender  they also did not reveal whether a runner wa aided by an eager dog pulling on a lead or hamstrung by having to navigate pothole and hill while pushing a wailing toddler in an unwieldy buggy Typically  the decision to remove the record ha done nothing to appease Parkrun s naysayer  Sharron Davies  the former Olympic swimmer turned campaigner  described the move a  cowardly  for not forcing transgender runner to be separated into their own category  To her  those who have changed gender must be stripped of a brilliant community event s multiple health benefit unless they publicly reveal themselves to all So no one ha won  While Parkrun try it hardest to focus solely on inclusion and positively impacting the life of a broad a range of people a possible   including hundred of thousand who would otherwise never engage with traditional sport or exercise   the call for it to be stripped of funding will carry on Maybe they will be successful and one of the most accepting  free  physical activity phenomenon of recent decade will find itself incapable of continuing  By it own admission  no one win at Parkrun  But everyone could stand to lose  Would that really be worth it More aboutParkrun1 5Everybody loses in Parkrun row   transgender

Parkrun event director quits over  inclusive policy  a CEO pleads to  turn heat down  on trans row All record were erased earlier this week  apparently after controversy that some woman s best were held by transgender runner Jeremy Wilson  Chief Sports Reporter 9 February 2024   7 10pm Related Topics Running  UK Athletics Parkrun is a mass participation running event held in public park every Saturday morning Credit  ALAMY Alan Harbottle Parkrun is facing a backlash over it decision to scrap all time record after a row over transgender athlete taking female record One event director resigned in response to the sudden removal of record a the organisation s chief executive pleaded for le  heat  over the trans debate All time gender record disappeared from the website of every Parkrun and Junior Parkrun around the world on Thursday Russ Jefferys  the chief executive of Parkrun  is adamant that the decision   which also includes scrapping best time across age and course bracket   wa not influenced by an ongoing campaign to make participant declare their sex at birth after it wa reported that at least three female record were set by transgender woman Weekly result of the 5km race  which is run by thousand of people every Saturday morning  will still be published  with Parkrun saying that it primary function is working a a public health charity rather than facilitating competition But the move fuelled accusation of  sex discrimination  from critic including former Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies  who said it had taken a  cowardly  position The Women s Rights Network said that Parkrun  would rather stop publishing age category data and ranking rather than allow fair sport for woman and girl   adding   there s only been uproar now because they d rather wipe record than be fair to woman  Mr Jefferys said   I think we need to be careful about making serious accusation   sadly there is just a lot of anger and emotion in this conversation  I think we would all benefit from just turning the heat down and remembering that  in the end  Parkrun is a free  fun community event and a great way to start the weekend   Not a competitive athletic event Speaking on BBC 5Live  Mr Jefferys wa challenged over Parkrun s suggestion that displaying record on the website had become off putting to new entrant and wa asked if they had received complaint  Not so much complaint but we conduct regular survey and we know that one of the biggest barrier   to participation is the misperception that Parkrun is a race   he said  I think the criticism we faced from the Women s Rights Network and others is down to a total misunderstanding of what Parkrun is  It is not a race  It is not a competitive athletic event  He added that since the event s inception a a time trial in 2004  it ha  clearly evolved  into a  health charity  The chief executive s comment came after a Parkrun official quit his role over the move Mick Anglim announced his departure a Brockenhurst s Parkrun event director on Thursday night  writing on Facebook that he had resigned  in response to HQ s new  inclusive  policy  He later told Telegraph Sport that  everyone that I ve spoken to agrees that the removal of age category and age grade record is a mistake   Mr Anglim  who won the world duathlon title for over 75s in 2022  said that he would not completely abandon the Brockenhurst event  which ha attracted almost 14 000 people aged between four and 90  but that the change had reduced  motivation and challenge for all age group   If the record offend you  don t look at them The Facebook page  Parkrun Statsgeek Group   which ha more than 13 000 member  launched an online poll to gauge opinion about the change  Of more than 2 200 response  82 per cent indicated their disagreement with the new policy Members aired their dismay in comment  The most disappointing news I ve heard in a very long time   wrote Christian Dyer   Why would parkrun wish to take away feature adored by the vast majority to please a tiny   if that   minority   It s simply absurd and very sad  Nat Konners said that she had an  80 year old friend who is motivated by going out to see if they can get the age record at different parkruns  and that they would probably now lose motivation   How s that fair  Seriously if the record etc personally offend you  don t look   she said Paul Curtayne questioned whether people would really be put off   a ha been suggested by Parkrun   by the now removed tab of record and  drill down stats  that wa previously on their website   It s obviously nonsense   he said   I know many runner who run 40 50 minute and are not remotely worried that there are faster people  It s pretty patronising to suggest that  World Athletics  along with domestic running governing body  ha moved to ban transgender woman from female competition over the past year Campaigners are calling for a  sex at birth  category in Parkrun but organiser have refused  saying that it wa a community event rather than a race  This leaf runner free to continue self selecting their gender  amid concern that transgender people  whose transition might be entirely private  would stop attending if a  sex at birth  category wa mandated Runners wearing  Save Women s Sport  T Shirts are planning to continue their protest this weekend Heather Binning  the founder of the Women s Rights Network  replied   Whilst Mr Jefferys belief that the fact Parkrun is not a race  debatable   nor a sport  debatable   he himself is missing the point that self id is not law in this country   Parkrun receives million pound of public fund to increase participation of woman and therefore the fact that their policy permit men to self identify in this category is wrong on many

organized in large part by PRISM  an LGBTQ advocacy group leading the  Let Trans People Drive  campaign  The organization worked with Youth Action Fund  Equality Florida  Hope CommUnity Center  GLSEN Central Florida and SPEKTRUM Health  Participants will stage die in to underscore the devastating consequence of effort to erase the transgender community s legal recognition   read a PRISM press release  PRISM ha also asked President Joe Biden s administration and the Justice Department to intervene and prohibit the change in policy based on the federal Real ID Act from 2005  That allows the establishment of federal criterion for government IDs  A virtual campaign through Wednesday promoted more than 650 email to the administration seeking intervention in the Florida policy  The event served to spotlight a change in state policy on issuing state IDs  While the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles  FLHSMV  in May 2022 updated it guideline to allow a change in gender of state IDs without proof of gender reassignment surgery  the state agency sent out a memo to Tax Collector s Offices in January reversing that policy  FLHSMV Deputy Executive Director Robert Kynoch wrote in a memo to every Tax Collector s Office that the term gender  doe not refer to a person s internal sense of his or her gender role or identification  but ha historically and commonly been understood a a synonym for  sex   which is determined by innate and immutable biological and genetic characteristic   That memo said having a state ID or license listing a gender that did not align with gender assigned at birth would effectively be violating Florida s statute prohibiting false IDs  That would make individual guilty of a felony and subject to up to five year of prison or probation and a  5 000 fine  The FL DMV is killing trans people  so we re showing them the consequence pic twitter com HyjSDHLyK8   PRISM FL  Inc    prism fl  February 9  2024 Post Views  0 Jacob

 They got your DL up on their car laptop before they ever even hit the blue light  ya know  To pull or not to pull  that question is answered by your information on the police laptop if you just have a broken taillight or some piddly thing like going 10 to 14mph over the limit  rolling a stop sign  Your personal data is in play for the decision cop make  Male Female or other on their laptop screen allows for their profiling woman driver  Same go for race and weight  Race and weight have no bearing on anyone s ability to drive a car  Why do the cop get to know that info via their laptop while deciding whether to initiate a traffic stop  Gender  race  weight on a DL  those are nothing but profiling  profiling  profiling  Reply DaveFebruary 9  2024 at 4 44 pm Exactly  They profile because of their hatred  and rationalize because of their greed  Cops get away with heftier fine and ticketing to minority  this is just another way to keep the working class divided and impoverished  When there is no more money in targeting minority  they won t hesitate to turn on white ci men  Cop s authority will always be above the working class  it s social caste s all the way down  Reply BillFebruary 9

 TRUMP pardoned the law breaking law man from Arizona  Vote GOP  the party of law and order for you  but not for u  Reply I swing You swingFebruary 9  2024 at 2 01 pm Agreed  It s no one s business  I should be allowed to enter whatever bathroom I choose  I should be able to shower in whatever gym facility I use and their locker room a well  Reply Keith WilsonFebruary 9  2024 at 2 28 pm When your entire  identity  depends on the action of OTHER people  you have a very weak point  Reply Dont Say FLAFebruary 10  2024 at 11 02 am You d be totally fine having  Female  stamped on your driving license  right Keith  Reply Scott W February 9  2024 at 2 59 pm There s nothing controversial about requiring your chromosome to be included on your state issued ID  The reaction of these jackass to reality is what is controversial  Reply Dont Say FLAFebruary 10  2024 at 11 04 am Because DL info is available to police on their car laptop  a DL should have zero information that can be used for profiling  You know there s cop out there who have it in for woman driver  right  And there s other cop out there who might decide to see if the lady on their laptop will trade them a favor to get out of that DUI  too  Reply Scott W February 10  2024 at 4 09 pm Because somebody might do something bad isn t a legitimate reason not to put sex on identification  Reply Dont Say FLAFebruary 11  2024 at 11 59 am Granted  potential misuse isn t always a reason to ban legitimate thing  But what reason IS there for having gender on a driving license  What s the point  Why s it there  What purpose can it have other than potential abuse  Do they need to know what s in your pant when you buy beer  No  Do they need to know what s in your pant when you drive  No Voting  Nope  Is there anything  Why is it there at all  Was it that some sneaky female might have signed up for the military  They can do that these day openly a female  Is it a poopy room thing  Have you ever showed your DL to get into your appropriate public bathroom  No  So why  Why s it on there  What s the point  Is a traffic stop le threatening when it a female  If so  that get cop killed  Cops let their guard down  that s when they get killed  If for no other reason  for officer safety alone  driving license should have gender entirely removed  Reply Scott W February 11  2024 at 2 29 pm It s on ID to help identify the person  you dunce  With your logic why even have their surname on the ID  Reply Dont Say FLAFebruary 12  2024 at 11 36 am The driving license number identifies the person  and the only need for ID when driving should be to know whether your license exists and is current  Everything else on a license these day is for profiling via the laptop in every popomobile  Reply Scott W February 12  2024 at 6 56 pm If I were a cop I would definitely want to know the sex of the people I had to pull over  Reply Leave a Reply Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published  Required field are marked

even if they re not out at home  though Kansas is not among the state with a law that explicitly say to do that Republican Kris Kobach s action wa his latest move to restrict transgender right  following his successful effort last year to temporarily block Democratic Gov  Laura Kelly s administration from changing the listing for sex on transgender people s birth certificate and driver s license to reflect their gender identity  It s also part of a trend of GOP attorney general asserting their authority in culture war issue without a specific state law Kobach maintains that failing to disclose when a child is socially transitioning or identifying a nonbinary at school violates parent  right  He sent letter in December to six school district and the state association for local school board member  then followed up with a public statement Thursday after four district  all in northeast Kansas  didn t rewrite their policy The Kansas attorney general s letter to superintendent of three Kansas City area district  Topeka s superintendent and the Kansas Association of School Boards accused them of having  surrendered to woke gender ideology   His letter didn t say what he would do if they didn t specifically require teacher and administrator to out transgender and nonbinary student LGBTQ  right advocate saw the letter a seeking policy that put transgender and nonbinary youth in physical danger but also a an attempt to tell transgender people that they re not welcome  Jordan Smith  leader of the Kansas chapter of the LGBTQ  right group Parasol Patrol  said forced outing will create more anxiety for student and even push some back into the closet  It s like they don t want u to exist in public place   said Smith  who is nonbinary  Five state have law requiring school to inform parent if their child use different pronoun  socially transition to a gender different than the one assigned at birth or present a nonbinary  according to the Movement Advancement Project  which support transgender right  Another six have law that encourage it  the project say Kansas is on neither list  A bill introduced last year would bar school from using the preferred pronoun for a student under 18 without a parent or guardian s written permission  but it did not clear a Senate committee  GOP lawmaker did enact a law over Kelly s veto that ended the state s legal recognition of transgender and nonbinary identity by defining male and female for legal purpose based on a person s  reproductive anatomy  identified at birth  But Republican state Sen  Renee Erickson of Wichita  a vocal supporter and a former middle school principal  said it doe not cover issue about whether school must inform parent about a child s gender identity at school Erickson said she now favor taking a look at the bill before a Senate committee  saying it address a  policy gap   The parent have a right to know what is affecting their child   she said In 2022 a federal judge hearing a northeast Kansas teacher s lawsuit concluded that her school district s policy of not informing parent of a child s gender identity at school without their consent violated a parent s constitutional right to raise child a they see fit  The district settled the case  paid the teacher  95 000 and revoked the policy The judge said parent  constitutional right include a say  in what a minor child is called and by what pronoun they are referred  But Kobach cited neither that case nor Kansas law in his letter to the state school board association  the Topeka school district and the Kansas City  Shawnee Mission and Olathe district in the Kansas City area  Instead he cited U S  Supreme Court decision going back a far a 1923 that he said affirmed parent  right  His office released copy Thursday He told each district that it policy on transgender student violated parent  right and said two other district in the Wichita area quickly rewrote their policy after his letter arrived  In his letter to the school board group  he noted it provides legal help to local district In each letter he said withholding such information from parent would be  arrogant beyond belief   State attorney general serve a the lead lawyer for state government  and most also oversee at least some criminal prosecution  But they also look outward  and Kobach s letter weren t the first to issue warning not grounded in a specific state law Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita launched an online form Tuesday to gather complaint about  objectionable curriculum  policy  or program affecting child  in education  His office said it will follow up on submission that may violate Indiana law but added that material don t have to meet that criterion to be posted for people to review  Last year  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent request to at least two medical provider that don t operate in his state for information about providing gender affirming care a part of an investigation  though it s not clear what Texas law would cover them  Washington state s attorney general invoked a law there to block Seattle Children s Hospital from complying  and QueerMed  a Georgia based telehealth provider  said on it website that it will not comply As for Kobach  Tom Alonzo  a Kansas City LGBTQ  right advocate  argued that the attorney general is bent on  intentional marginalization  of transgender people  Micah Kubic  executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas  said Kobach is ignoring student  right to privacy and called the attorney general s stance  cruel  and  dangerous   While the Kansas City district declined comment  the other three district said they deal with transgender and nonbinary student case by case and seek to work with parent  The Topeka district expressed confidence that it practice are legal  The four district are among the largest in Kansas and together have more than 88 000 student or 18  of the total for the state s public school  The strongest response came from Michelle Hubbard  the Shawnee Mission superintendent  in her district s response in December  She chided Kobach for not citing actual case in the district of parent  right being violated and suggested that he wa relying on  misinformation  from  partisan source    We are not caricature from the polarized medium  but rather real people who work very hard in the face of intense

in Chinatown  Chinatown Together and Vancouver Lunar New Year For All  told CTV News they were both invited to apply to participate by the Vancouver Chinatown Spring Festival Celebration Committee  After applying in January  both received email stating they had been denied  and needed to show documentation they were registered non profit  Melody Ma  a co founder with Chinatown Together said this requirement wa never communicated on the application form or included in the rule and regulation  Ma said she submitted the requested form  the group wa approved  and then day later  the decision wa rescinded   We were disappointed  we were disheartened and shocked   Ma said   Political activism  The rejection email from the Vancouver Chinatown Spring Festival Celebration Committee   a group made up of six organization including the Chinese Benevolent Association of Vancouver  said   While your passion for advocacy ha been recognized  it is essential to underscore that political activism find no place within the spirit of this event   Ma said there wa nothing political about the group wanting to be included in the event  She said member had spent hour sewing banner with the word   Chinatown Together   and  Embracing Rainbows    Many of u have a strong connection to the Chinatown parade   Ma said   It ha a significant place in our heart   Ma grew up dancing in the parade a one of Mimi Ho s Strathcona Chinese dancer   Finding out that  a an adult  I can t participate in the parade and we are banned from marching on baseless accusation  is really disappointing   she said  In an emailed statement to CTV News  The Vancouver Chinatown Spring Festival Celebration Committee said it s  committed to upholding the tradition of promoting community  collaboration and tolerance across culture    We are also committed to ensuring that the parade is a safe and inclusive event for all participant and spectator   the statement said  adding it will make the decision to accept or reject parade team application based on this criterion   It just feel really frustrating  Pearl Wong  an organizer with Vancouver Lunar New Year For All   which wa also denied   said the group wa created due to a lack of LGBTQ representation   We thought it would be nice to have that  a Queer and Trans people who are also of Asian heritage   Wong said   We wanted a group that wa by u and for u   Wong said the committee s non profit regulation wa never relayed to organizer or outlined in the application  Ultimately  Wong said due to timing they weren t able to apply for non profit status and had to bow out of being in the parade  They said they followed up with the committee for clarification into the decision  but no answer wa provided   Lunar New Year is a festival of coming together  of being together with family and community  and so for them to put these gate behind folk  it just feel really frustrating to see that happen   they said  The parade is set to take place Sunday and is one of the largest celebration in the community  drawing thousand of people  Ma and Wong said they still plan on attending  even a spectator  Ma added that since receiving the news about the rejection  dozen of people plan to show up in solidarity Sunday for the group to celebrate what the event is all about   community   Chinatown s sustainability and the sustainability of this culture

that we needed to have this conversation with our daughter   The girl s father said the  worst case scenario  from the cyberbullying targeted at his daughter due to Cline s post could have led her to

our society come to   Kingsley  a biological man  identifies a a Muslim woman and life in the Detroit  Michigan area  Apparently Kinglsey had his testicle removed a part of his gender affirming  care   and now want them back  Though the story broke back in August  Reduxx s post of the court hearing ha re upped concern   and mockery   over how delusional our society ha gotten   She had had her testicle removed   William Wojciechowsk  the ex  said in the hearing   I believe if I recalled correctly  it wa March 23 and they were left in the fridge  I wanted nothing to do with it  I thought it wa odd but I try not to judge because everybody s a little different   Yeah  no kidding  It s weird enough that Kingsley wanted to get his testicle removed to further convince himself that he s a girl   but to keep them in the fridge   Odd  is putting it nicely   They were there from April of 2022 until July of 2023  when I disposed of them   Wojciechowsk told the judge  The video cut to Kingsley talking again  He stood there in a turban  holding a fluffy dog and said   that physical anomaly  the ball  ha been a point of stress in my life since I can remember and my middle name that I chose is Dee because my whole life I ve been called Big D  I m Dee from the D and I thank God that these  deez nut  were extracted and they were put into a biohazard bag    For s  t and giggle  I put them in a mason jar and I put them in the fridge next to the egg   Kingsley confessed  A trans identified male in Michigan is suing his ex partner for the return of his preserved testicle  which he had kept in their shared fridge following his genital surgery  Brianna Kingsley  who identifies a a Muslim woman  is demanding  6 500 for the loss of  deez nut   pic twitter com 0JRVQiqRb4   REDUXX   ReduxxMag  February 8  2024 Firstly  it always baffle me when transgender people  who clearly don t listen to anything the Bible or God say  thank God for His assistance in their transgender  care   Secondly  imagine opening up the fridge to make an omelet  You reach to grab a carton of egg and your hand graz a jar with year old surgically extracted human testicle inside  Related   Dragging  Kids Away from Normalcy  Groomers on the Go That take cringe  and honestly the idea of a gag reflex  to a whole new level  But still  Kingsley s suing over the supposed loss   The amount that I m claiming is for the damage of not having these nut with me   Kingsley added confidently  What  wa he going to snuggle them when going to sleep or something  In response to the video posted by Reduxx  many individual were in disbelief   HOW IS THIS REAL   one commentedwhile another asked   Is this satire   Others said thing like   Gender Ideology exacerbates existing mental disorder and creates them where they didn t exist before   while another said   What a time to be alive   It really is unfortunate that this story isn t satire  I hope Mr  Brianna get his nut back safe and sound and then check himself into the

Advertisement Hamilton s title  Surfing Past Fear  is about overcoming fearful and limiting thought in order to stay in the game and beat the odds  Meanwhile  Gaines  first title  Happy No Snakes Day  is about the danger of believing in lie  and that standing for truth is worth it  no matter what the consequence  Both of these woman are vocal opponent of transgender men participating in woman s sport  but they were also there to encourage and support family in building an Army of Truth in a culture that appears to want to traffic in lie and mistruths  Of course  there cannot be a Brave Books

transgender Americans ever conducted ha found trans people continue to suffer discrimination  harassment and even violence at work  in medicine and at school   but that people who transition have much higher satisfaction in life  and many have supportive family This is the first report to document transgender experience en masse in eight year  and come amid sustained political attack on trans right from conservative Wishes come true for trans youth thanks to Transanta donor  goodwillRead more There s still a drought of information available to lawmaker  the medium and advocate regarding our experience and our need   Rodrigo Heng Lehtinen  executive director of the National Coalition for Transgender Equality  NCTE   said  according to NBC News  At best  we re working in a vacuum of information  At worst  we re combating dangerous misinformation being spread by anti trans extremist   he continued   Without question  the misinformation and lack of understanding is underpinning these escalating legislative attack against our community  The report  called the 2022 US Trans Survey  present an early look at finding from a survey of more than 92 000 people who identify a binary or nonbinary transgender adult  It is the first such report since the NCTE produced a survey of more than 28 000 individual in 2015  Individuals were asked a variety of more than 600 possible question  No respondent received all question Importantly  the transgender survey is large but is not random  Although surveyor weighted the response to try to account for bias  people who took the survey might still be unrepresentative of transgender people living in the US a a whole The report found that 94  of transgender individual who live at least part of the time in a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth   in other word  who  transitioned    were either  a lot   79   or  a little more satisfied   15   with their life  Nearly 98  of respondent were receiving some kind of hormone replacement therapy  which made them  a lot   84   or  a little   14   more satisfied with their life  Obtaining hormone therapy through the informed consent model and having access to surgery ha definitely changed my life for the better   one survey respondent  named Taylor  said   It certainly didn t fix all of my problem instantly  but it fixed a lot of problem that my dysphoria caused  Now that I ve been on HRT and had surgery  I can live my day to day life without pain  dissociation  and misery  Conversely  the sustained political attack on transgender individual  almost entirely from the right wing  made about half of trans respondent  47   consider moving location  At least 10 state force trans individual to use public bathroom that correspond to their gender assigned at birth in at least some situation  a opposed to a choice aligned with the gender they identify a  22 state ban gender affirming care for transgender youth  24 ban transgender youth sport participation Transgender individual also continue to suffer discrimination  harassment and even violence  More than a third were experiencing poverty  34  compared with 12  of the US population   More than one in 10  11   said they had been forced out of a job because of their gender identity  and about 18  were unemployed  compared with 3 5  of the US population in December 2022  Further  nearly one third  30   said they were verbally harassed in the last 12 month and 39  said they were harassed online  About one in 10  9   said they were offered unequal treatment  Three per cent said they were physically attacked in the last 12 month These experience contrasted sharply with the support many trans individual received from family  support that tended to increase with age  Forty three per cent of trans individual aged 16 17 said their family were supportive  all the way up to 63  of individual older than 65 who felt their family were supportive  My whole life ha been affected by the fact that my family wa very accepting of me   said Amanda  who is older than 50   I m not exactly sure why  but both of my parent always supported my gender and sexual expression even before it wa popular to do so

proposed or passed legislation targeting transgender people  The data make it clear that gender affirming care help trans people feel more satisfied with their life   said Rodrigo Heng Lehtinen  executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality  in an email to CBS News   And still  we see discriminatory policy in state all around the country that cause real harm by creating barrier to such care   Nearly half of respondent said they had thought about moving to another state because the government in their home state had  considered or passed law that target transgender people for unequal treatment   including banning access to bathroom  health care or sport  Five percent of respondent  or one in 20 people  said they had actually moved because of such legislation

vast improvement in life satisfaction after transitionThe National Center for Transgender Equality released early insight from it 2022 U S  Transgender Survey  the largest survey of trans people in U S  history Get more newsonPrintFeb  7  2024  5 01 AM UTCBy Jo YurcabaA survey of more than 90 000 transgender people in the U S    the largest nationwide survey of the community ever   found that trans people continue to experience workplace and medical discrimination  However  the overwhelming majority of them still report more life satisfaction after having transitioned  The National Center for Transgender Equality  or NCTE  one of the country s largest trans right organization  released it 2022 U S  Transgender Survey Early Insights report Wednesday after a yearslong delay due  in part  to the pandemic  The survey  the most comprehensive look to date at life for transgender people in the U S   come a hundred of bill in the last three year have attempted to roll back trans right  most often by restricting trans people s access to transition related health care and trans student  ability to play school sport  There s still a drought of information available to lawmaker  the medium and advocate regarding our experience and our need   NCTE Executive Director Rodrigo Heng Lehtinen said at a news conference Tuesday   At best  we re working in a vacuum of information  At worst  we re combating dangerous misinformation being spread by anti trans extremist  Without question  the misinformation and lack of understanding is underpinning these escalating legislative attack against our community  A woman attends a rally in support of trans youth in school on June 26  2023  outside the Fayette County Public Schools central office in Lexington  Ky Ryan C  Hermens   Lexington Herald Leader via Getty Images fileThe organization s 2015 U S  Transgender Survey had been the largest survey of trans people in the country  with nearly 28 000 respondent 18 and older  and it ha been widely cited  including by Congress and the Supreme Court  Josie Caballero  the director of the survey  said the 2022 iteration more than tripled the number of respondent   with a total of 92 329 from every state and many U S  territory   and wa improved in a number of other way  For example  it included 605 possible question  though no respondent received all possible question   up from 324 in the 2015 survey  and it included more than 8 000 respondent who were 16 and 17  However  study author note that respondent who participated in the online survey were not drawn from a random sample and that though the sample is large  the finding might not be representative of all trans people  Of the 84 170 adult respondent  38  identified a nonbinary  35  identified a transgender woman  25  identified a transgender men and 2  identified a cross dresser  Continued discrimination and mistreatmentAmong the key finding released Wednesday  the survey found that trans people continue to report experiencing discrimination and mistreatment because of their gender identity and or expression More than one third of adult respondent  or 34   were experiencing poverty at the time of the survey  and 18  were unemployed  More than 1 in 10  or 11   of respondent who had ever held job said they had been fired or forced to resign or had lost job or been laid off because of their gender identity or expression  And  in line with previous survey finding  30  of respondent had experienced homelessness in their lifetime  Of adult respondent who saw health care provider in the previous 12 month  48  reported having had at least one negative experience because they were transgender  including being refused health care  having staff member use the incorrect pronoun for them or having provider use abusive language or be physically rough or abusive while treating them  Fear of mistreatment prevented 24  of respondent from seeing doctor when they needed it in the 12 month before the survey  Many respondent also reported past mistreatment in school  Of adult respondent  80  who were out or perceived a trans in K 12 experienced one or more form of mistreatment  including verbal harassment  physical attack  online bullying or being denied use of the restroom or locker room that matched their gender identity  Of the 8 159 respondent who were 16 and 17  60  reported such mistreatment Higher life satisfaction after transitionDespite those negative experience  the vast majority of adult respondent  79   who lived at least some of the time in different gender from the one they were assigned at birth reported that they were  a lot more satisfied  with their life  An additional 15  reported they were  a little more satisfied   Respondents who received transition related medical care reported similarly high rate of satisfaction  Of respondent who were currently receiving hormone treatment  84  said receiving such treatment for their gender identity transition made them  a lot more satisfied  with their life  and 14  said it made them  a little more satisfied   Just 1  said hormone treatment made them neither more nor le satisfied  and le than 1  said hormone treatment made them a lot le satisfied Of respondent who underwent at least one form of gender affirming surgery  88  said it made them  a lot more satisfied   and 9  said it made them a little more satisfied  Less than 2  total said surgery made them a little le or a lot le satisfied   That might seem obvious to some of u that of course if you re transgender and you need transition related health care  of course your life is better off when you get that health care   Heng Lehtinen said Tuesday   But it s really important to have actually asked people and found out objectively what is their experience  because transition related health care is otherwise so under attack in state legislature around the country  Effects of anti trans legislationIn the last three year  23 state have restricted gender affirming health care   including puberty blocker  hormone therapy and surgery   for minor and  in a few case  adult  according to the Movement Advancement Project  an LGBTQ think tank  Half of state have banned trans student athlete from playing school sport on the team that align with their gender identity rather than their assigned sex at birth  while 10 state have passed law restricting what bathroom trans people can use in school  college and or government owned building Nearly half of respondent to the latest U S  Transgender Survey said they had thought about moving to other state because their state government considered or passed such law that target transgender people  and 5    about 4 600 people   said they had actually moved to other state because of such legislation  The top 10 state where trans respondent most often reported moving from were  in alphabetical order  Alabama  Arizona  Florida  Georgia  Missouri  North Carolina  Ohio  Tennessee  Texas and Virginia

well a overseas territory and dependency and military personnel serving outside the country   making it one of the largest study ever conducted  Asking people about healthcare  family  education  gender identity and transition  it found that almost all respondent  94 per cent  who lived  at least some of the time in a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth  reported that they were either  a lot more satisfied   79 per cent   or  a little more satisfied   15 per cent  with life  Meanwhile  98 per cent reported that receiving hormone treatment made them either  a lot

identity and get the health care they need  but we also see that trans people face substantial barrier to living full  healthy and authentic life   As the most comprehensive source of data about trans people in the US  these finding fill an important gap in our knowledge and serve a a critical resource for understanding and addressing the need of trans people   And Rodrigo Heng Lehtinen  an executive director at NCTE  said   Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and fairness  We need law at federal and state level that make sure all people   including trans people   are treated

group    Feb 11  2024   NottheBee com For the trans activist who have watched in dismay a their narrative ha crumbled before their eye  here come the cavalry to the rescue Too bad for them it s F Troop No matter  the medium power were all too eager to fall in line and report on the survey a if it were a legitimate study sponsored by dispassionate researcher interested in pursuing the truth and not a marketing piece sponsored by The National Center for Transgender Equality  NCTE  a self proclaimed advocacy group interested in pursuing a narrative It had to be legit  right  Why  it wa the  biggest survey ever  The Guardian clearly can t get enough of this having published a different survey last year which showed only 78  were happier Why  trans people are getting happier by the minute Interestingly  that older survey wa made up of nearly two third of people who called themselves  trans non binary  or  trans gender nonconforming  meaning    what  You transitioned to not a gender  Is that a half trans  What if you trans from non binary to gender nonconforming  Are you transtrans Don t worry  they are a confused a you are Moreover  le than a third were on hormone therapy and half that had had surgery  meaning the vast majority of respondent were playing dress up more than anything else No matter  this latest super scientific survey ups the ante in the endless race to be the most supportive How super scientific wa it It employed that gold standard of all survey The celebrity endorsement And not just any celebrity endorsement  but endorsement from celebrity with an enormous pro trans following The US Trans Survey is LIVE  If you are a trans person over the age of 16  go to ustranssurvey org and take the survey now When it come to data integrity  you can keep your random probability sampling  give me an Instagram post targeting people who already agree with you any day And yes  16 is the cutoff  two year younger than the last NCTE survey The study included individual aged 16 and older at the time of survey completion The smart money say it will be even lower the next time I downloaded the preliminary result available via PDF The survey wa supported by a number of trans advocacy group all divided and categorized by race because if you aren t practicing overt segregation  you re doing intersectionality wrong And you re a racist  but that s assumed They were careful to reach out to a broad array of group representing everybody from those who support the cause wholeheartedly  to those who support the cause even more wholeheartedly The outreach period began approximately one year before the survey launch  and the outreach team used various strategy to connect with transgender people through multiple point of access  such a through transgender   or LGBTQ    support group  health center  and online community The people hanging around the group that explicitly support the trans industrial complex are probably not the one who either regret their transition or have already detransitioned It would be like running a survey about abortion targeting Planned Parenthood member or a poll on putting pineapple on pizza by only asking psychopath You re going to get the result you wanted Throughout the outreach period  the team conducted a survey pledge campaign  which wa among the most important method for engaging and communicating with potential respondent Just to be crystal clear  They recruited the most committed advocate to pledge fealty to the cause and recruit the like minded This wasn t a study  This wa a pep rally The campaign invited potential participant and ally to pledge to take the survey and or spread the word about the survey And ally  Hold that thought for just a second The survey wa anonymous  and maintaining privacy and confidentiality in the collection and maintenance of survey data wa an important component of preserving participant  anonymity Anonymous  So     anyone could take the survey  including  ally  eager to support the cause I swear  could this survey get any more legitimate  All it need now is a sweepstakes As an incentive to complete the survey  participant were offered the opportunity to enter into a random drawing for one of three cash prize upon completion of the survey  including one  500 cash prize and two  250 cash prize The report didn t mention what percentage were taking hormone  had surgery  or unhappy childhood  that last one wa 46  in the Washington Post survey   Not to worry A detailed description of the methodology will be included in the full report of the 2022 U S  Transgender Survey After the headline  attention  and scrutiny die down I have no idea what percentage of trans people are happier following their transition  and this survey certainly doesn t tell me either  It is comically bad and corrupt from the start  That our alleged watchdog in the medium would slavishly report on it a if it wa anything other than a slickly produced advertising brochure tell you everything you need to know about them Look  if you re going to gaslight me  at least show me some respect and make it look half believable  P S  Now check out our latest video   Keep up with our

that people who want   The host pushed one more time   My question to you wa about whether Peter Spooner would get an apology  not about people listening to the clip   Philp repeated his line   Okay

2024iStock Daniel GoldinIt s been a week to forget for surf company Rip Curl  the latest brand to risk consumer  wrath with a pro transgender marketing campaign  Their January post urging people to meet  waterwoman  Sasha Lowerson  a biological man in a bikini  lit a literal fire under fan  who took to the internet to burn everything from surf booty to board Days after deleting the reel  with international outrage at a peak  headquarters decided to do something that Bud Light still hasn t  apologize In a revealing move  management issued a mea culpa late Wednesday night  just five day into the dustup   Our recent post ha landed u in the divisive space around transgender participation in competitive sport   a spokesman told Shop Eat Surf late Wednesday night   We want to promote surfing for everyone in a respectful way  but recognize we upset a lot of people with our post and for that  we are sorry  To clarify  the surfer featured ha not replaced anyone on the Rip Curl team and is not a sponsored athlete  If Americans want to know who s winning the war with corporate bully  look no further  A reversal like this is majorly significant   not only because of how intense the backlash wa  but how quickly executive responded  If anything  the wave of corporate pushback that wa sparked by Bud Light ha only intensified over time  In fact  it s so powerful that even the medium is starting to admit that the grassroots may actually be winning this fight   Big corporates may finally be learning that  Go woke  go broke  is real   commentator Nicolle Flint pointed out      T he once iconic Australian surf brand is living proof that woman are finally fighting back against company using transgender woman to promote product for woman and girl   she wrote   What is most significant about the Rip Curl campaign featuring Sasha Lowerson that wa removed from Instagram just five day after being posted  is that this is the first time a major brand ha responded to female backlash   Whether the company  woke up  soon enough to the fact that the backlash from woman wa serious and potentially financially damaging remains to be seen  That s a blow to the company s relatively new CEO  who  pre Bud Light  told The Sydney Morning Herald when she wa hired in 2021 that her goal wa to drift left   You still want to be cool enough to recruit that next generation   Brooke Farris said   but I think by approaching it from a place of inclusivity  people will be attracted to that  Turns out  people were not attracted to that   and willing to sink her brand to prove it  Meanwhile  Bethany Hamilton  the courageous face of Rip Curl from 1999 to 2023  is surely looking on with satisfaction  A year into her renewed contract with the company  the two side abruptly parted way last year  almost certainly because of Hamilton s opposition to the new rule allowing biological men to compete in woman s surfing  The devoted Christian and shark attack survivor  whose comeback story inspired the world  reiterated her stand at the height of the Rip Curl controversy  posting   Male bodied athlete should not be competing in woman s sport  Period  Amazingly  those mainstream view have still made Hamilton a public target  Most recently  a mob of LGBT activist tried   and failed   to have Bethany disinvited from a speaking engagement at a Wisconsin fundraiser for underserved girl  In a three page missive signed by 200 trans ally  they demand that the Women s Fund of the Oshkosh Area Community Foundation take  all possible step to remove and replace Bethany Hamilton a  Power of the Purse  keynote speaker  lest she creates more  discrimination  distrust  division  and harm  In another sign that activist are fighting a losing battle  the Foundation refused to be intimidated  Leaders released a statement to local outlet WHBY insisting the event will go on a planned   Over the year  the Women s Fund Power of the Purse event ha hosted a wide range of powerful speaker from all background whose diverse experience and perspective have imparted impactful lesson of hope  and perseverance   and Bethany Hamilton is no different  Both a world renowned athlete and survivor  Ms  Hamilton will share her own story with our community of overcoming obstacle  facing fear and triumphing a an individual  Although her scheduled appearance ha been met with some criticism due to her reported personal view on transgender athlete   we still very much believe her inspirational message of determination and resilience can transcend our difference  For a corporate culture used to flaunting it extremism without consequence  Rip Curl s regret prof one thing  there are choppy water ahead for woke business Originally published at The Washington Stand

I personally feel shocked by his comment and feel he should apologise for his remark  A series of Conservative MPs also rounded on Sunak for insensitivity after he pressed ahead with an apparently

Rishi Sunak after he made a  dehumanising  transgender remark in the Commons while the victim s mother visited Parliament  Peter Spooner said he wa  shocked  by the comment made during Prime Minister s Questions  in which the PM accused Sir Keir Starmer of having difficulty in  defining a woman   The remark have prompted an immediate backlash  but Mr Sunak ha refused to apologise  with Downing Street later insisting the comment were  totally legitimate  and denying they were transphobic  Try MEN Premium now for FREE    just click here to give it a go Mr Spooner told Sky News   As the Prime Minister for our country to come out with degrading comment like he did  regardless of them being in relation to discussion in Parliament  they are absolutely dehumanising  Identities of people should not be used in that manner  and I personally feel shocked by his comment and feel he should apologise for his remark   In response to his call for an apology  Government minister Laura Trott denied the remark had been a  joke  and insisted they had  absolutely nothing to do with this appalling tragedy   However  it is understood Brianna s family ha now been invited to a meeting about online safety   which her mother  Esther Ghey  is campaigning to improve   with the Prime Minister and Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan  In an exchange with the Leader of the Opposition  Mr Sunak said   We are bringing the waiting list down for the longest waiter and making progress  but it is a bit rich to hear about promise from someone who ha broken every single promise he wa elected on   I think I have counted almost 30 in the last year  Pensions  planning  peerage  public sector pay  tuition fee  childcare  second referendum  defining a woman   although in fairness  that wa only 99  of a U turn   Sir Keir  who met Brianna s mother  Esther Ghey  on Wednesday  condemned the Prime Minister s remark  with a chorus of opposition backbencher calling out   Shame    Of all the week to say that  when Brianna s mother is in this chamber  Shame   Sir Keir said   Parading a a man of integrity when he s got absolutely no responsibility   Number 10 declined repeatedly to apologise for Mr Sunak s language and said it wa part of a  legitimate  criticism of Labour  Mr Sunak s press secretary said   If you look back on what the Prime Minister wa saying  there wa a long list of U turn that the leader of the opposition had been making  I don t think those U turn are a joke  it is quite serious change in public policy  I think it is totally legitimate for the Prime Minister to point those out    It is clearly part of what happens in the chamber  at Prime Minister s Questions  to point out the U turn an opposition leader ha made   she added  Within the session  Mr Sunak also faced call to apologise from Labour MP Liz Twist  to which he did not directly respond  But  concluding Prime Minister s Questions  he said   If I could just say also to Brianna Ghey s mother who is here  a I said earlier this week  what happened wa an unspeakable and shocking tragedy  Brianna Ghey s father  Peter Spooner  ha demanded an apology from Rishi Sunak  Image  Manchester Evening News   As I said earlier this week  in the face of that  for her mother to demonstrate the compassion and empathy that she did last weekend  I thought demonstrated the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity  She deserves all our admiration and praise for that   Mr Sunak faced some criticism even from within his party rank over the comment  Former Tory business minister  Jackie Doyle Price  said it wa  careless  and  very ill judged  for him to use the joke  in that context   but also accused critic of having  weaponised  it   I find this pre rehearsed line on this issue really trivialises something that s very important so I ve become more uncomfortable with that   she told Times Radio   To say it in that context wa just  frankly  very ill judged  but I wa equally uncomfortable with the way that it wa weaponised   And I just think what an ugly situation all around  because  you know  there is a dead child here who s been murdered in the most appalling circumstance  And for that to be the exchange in the in the chamber of the House of Commons  it s just not my proudest moment to be a Member of Parliament I must say   Former junior minister Dehenna Davison  in a post on X  formerly Twitter  said it wa  disappointing to hear joke being made at the trans community s expense  and warned that  our word in the House resonate right across our society   The Bishop Auckland MP  who wa not in the chamber on Wednesday  said   As politician  it s our job to take the heat out of such debate and focus on finding sensible way forward  whilst ensuring those involved are treated with respect  Given some of the terrible incidence of transphobia we have seen lately  this need for respect feel more crucial than ever   Cabinet minister defended their party leader in the wake of the exchange  with Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch accusing Labour of trying to  weaponise  the issue  Ms Badenoch  who is also Equalities Minister  said on X   Every murder is a tragedy  None should be trivialised by political point scoring  As a mother  I can imagine the trauma that Esther Ghey ha endured  It wa shameful of Starmer to link his own inability to be clear on the matter of sex and gender directly to her grief   Chancellor Jeremy Hunt also told ITV News   It wa the most appalling tragedy and I think everyone ha been incredibly struck by the courage and resolve of Brianna s mother  Esther  throughout the whole of this terrible  terrible story   And we should also be clear  the Prime Minister wa not talking about that  he wa talking about the fact that Keir Starmer ha changed his position on that  a on many other issue   This is not the first time the Prime Minister ha attacked Labour over the issue of gender identity policy  which have been a frequent subject of debate in Westminster in recent year  LGBT  campaigner have condemned some of the language used by politician to discus transgender people  with the issue often drawn into the so called  culture war  by right winger  In his Tory conference speech last year  Mr Sunak told Conservative delegate in Manchester   We shouldn t get bullied into believing that people can be any sex they want to be  They can t   a man is a man and a woman is a woman   A Labour spokeswoman called on Mr Sunak to apologise   We don t think the country want or deserves a Prime Minister that is happy to use minority a a punchbag   she said  LGBT  charity Stonewall called Mr Sunak s word  cheap  callous and crass   A spokesperson said   The disrespect and dehumanisation of trans people that we see played out daily in the medium and in our political discourse ha real life consequence and it ha to stop  We call on the Prime Minister to apologise unreservedly for his comment  and for him to reflect on how careless word from those in power can and do result in harm  Story SavedYou can find this story in My Bookmarks Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right Follow Manchester

hypocrisy  in those who criticize LGBT blessingsAlvise ArmelliniVatican cityReutersPublished February 7  2024ShareBookmarkPlease log in to bookmark this story Log InCreate Free AccountPope Francis said he see  hypocrisy  in criticism of his decision to allow priest to bless same sex couple  possibly his most strongly worded defence of the move LGBT blessing were authorized last month by a Vatican document called Fiducia Supplicans  Supplicating Trust   but that ha met with significant resistance in the Catholic Church  particularly from African bishop  Nobody get scandalized if I give my blessing to a businessman who perhaps exploit people  and this is a very grave sin  But they get scandalized if I give them to a homosexual   Francis told Italian Catholic magazine Credere  This is hypocrisy   he said Credere released extract of the interview on Wednesday  a day ahead of publication Francis also said he  always  welcome LGBT people and remarried divorcee to the sacrament of confession  according to another passage published by Vatican medium  No one should be denied a blessing  Everyone  everyone  everyone  the pontiff said  repeating a three word slogan he used in August during a Catholic youth festival in Portugal Francis  who famously said  Who am I to judge   when asked about homosexuality at the beginning of his papacy  ha made it one of his mission to make the Catholic Church more welcoming and le judgmental Conservatives say this risk undermining the Church s moral teaching Francis ha defended Fiducia Supplicans on several occasion  but acknowledged the pushback against it  saying for example that priest should take into account local sensitivity when giving the blessing He also stressed that such blessing do not amount to formal Church approval for same sex union  When a couple come forward spontaneously to ask for them  one doe not bless the union  but simply the people who together have requested it  Not the union  but the person   Francis said on Jan  26 The Catholic Church teach that gay sex is sinful and disordered  and that people with same sex attraction  which are not considered sinful  should try to be chaste In another interview published last week by Italy s La Stampa daily  Francis said he hoped critic of LGBT blessing would eventually understand them  but that Africans were a  special case  in their opposition to homosexuality Bishops in Africa have effectively rejected the Fiducia Supplicans  saying it cannot be applied without causing scandal  The pope and the head of the Vatican s doctrinal department  Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez  have accepted that position In some African country  homosexuality is severely punished  with prison sentence or even the death penalty Report an errorRelated

GLAAD s board of director from 2013 until 2020 As a third generation firefighter and then fire captain  Lana Moore served the city of Columbus  Ohio  for 35 year  In 2008  she came out to her crew a transgender While some in the department grumbled  Moore said both her chief and union president were fully supportive  and two year after she retired in 2016  she wa inducted into the city s hall of fame That s why it pain her to know Ohio lawmaker   for whom  she said  she would have laid down her life a a firefighter   last month overrode Gov  Mike DeWine s veto of HB 68  a bill banning gender affirming care for young people and preventing transgender girl and woman from competing in female high school and college sport  And they re still mulling a slate of bill that would restrict transgender right and visibility  It s frightening   Moore said   It feel like I ve been betrayed  They ve identified a small minority of people they can stereotype and scapegoat  I m not a historian  but I paid attention in history class  and it s not hard to recognize what s happening here  As Republican lawmaker nationwide continue to introduce bill targeting the LGBTQ  community   and specifically transgender people   at rate on par with last year s record number  Moore and community advocate fear a rising tide of hostile rhetoric is designed to ultimately erase them from public life This week  Florida official revoked transgender resident  ability to update gender marker on driver s license and ID card  Utah passed a bill banning transgender people from bathroom corresponding to their gender identity  and Texas  attorney general pressed a clinic in Georgia for medical record of transgender young people who used telehealth to obtain gender affirming care there  It ha progressively gotten worse The Human Rights Campaign  among the country s largest LGBTQ  civil right group  said 130 bill targeting transgender right had been filed nationwide in 2024  compared with roughly 225 last year  Overall  the group said  325 anti LGBTQ  bill had been proposed in 2024 a of Jan  25  compared with 503 in all of 2023  For year  transgender people have warned of radical anti LGBTQ  force  true aim  to abuse governmental power to take away our freedom and drive trans people out of public society   said Kelley Robinson  the organization s president  in a statement decrying what she called a  sinister agenda   They want to humiliate  harass and use policy to eliminate transgender people from public life   she said Last week  Michigan news outlet Mlive com reported Republicans in the Michigan and Ohio legislature described banning access to gender affirming care for adult a well a young people a the  endgame  in a conversation on the social medium platform X Siobhan Boyd Nelson  co interim executive director of Equality Ohio  said the group wa  profoundly disappointed  in Ohio  lawmaker  unwillingness to listen to medical professional  young people and their family      There s absolutely no reason for government overreach into the personal medical decision of Ohioans   It ha progressively gotten worse  and we know that Ohio is not alone   Boyd Nelson said   We re seeing it happen across the country  and we think people should be very concerned about what appears to be an obsession with marginalizing and harming an already marginalized community  Anti equality bill outnumber those in supportWhen Moore grew up in the 1970s  she didn t know the term  transgender   not until she saw transgender actress and activist Christine Jorgensen on a talk show did she realize she wasn t the only person who felt a she did  I took an oath a a civil servant  and I took it seriously   Moore said   That didn t end when I retired  But it look like they ve  Republican lawmaker  taken an oath to a political party  According to health policy research organization KFF  23 state have enacted law or policy limiting youth access to gender affirming care a of Jan  31  while 21 state have law or policy imposing professional or legal penalty on health care practitioner who provide minor with such care Gender affirming care includes using hormone to delay puberty and support physical development aligning with a youth s identity  and ha been endorsed by major health group  including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics  Proponents of law prohibiting such care say the ban are intended to protect youth from making life altering decision at a young age  Families should never fear losing custody of their child for not consenting to superstitious gender ideology   Ohio state Rep  Gary Click  sponsor of HB 68  in a news release In his veto of that bill  Gov  DeWine said that should the bill become law   Ohio would be saying that the state  that the government know better what is medically best for a child than the two people who love that child the most  their parent  According to the Human Rights Campaign s 2023 State Equality Index  more than 253 pro equality bill were introduced nationwide last year  50 of them were signed into law In contrast  the campaign tallied 571 anti equality bill in 2023  with 77 of them becoming law The campaign gave 20 state and Washington it highest rating   working toward innovative equality    and another five were characterized a  solidifying equality   the index s next highest ranking But 23 other state  most of them in the South  were deemed  high priority to achieve basic equality   the list s lowest rating  States are trying to rewrite law to exclude LGBTQ  people from sex based protection  and they are continuing to try to erase LGBTQ  people from history  from the classroom  from artistic performance  and from sport   the report read  Other people are defining u Florida is among the state in the campaign s lowest rated category  In addition to revoking the ability of transgender people to change the listed gender on their driver s license  the state ha passed law restricting transgender people from using bathroom corresponding to their gender identity in public school and place  transgender youth participation in sport  gender affirming care for transgender young people and inclusion of LGBTQ  topic in school  The DeSantis administration s obsession with scapegoating transgender Floridians ha escalated into an outrageous attack that further erodes freedom and liberty in our state   said Nadine Smith  executive director of Equality Florida  in a statement   These reckless and hateful policy are intended to make the transgender community feel unsafe and unwelcome in Florida and to bully them out of public life entirely   Alaina Kupec  president of transgender advocacy group Gender Research Advisory Council   Education  or GRACE  said transgender people provide a  politically opportunistic  group for candidate to prey on  She started the organization out of exasperation over the rhetoric influencing public perception of the trans community  Nobody wa really changing the narrative being put out by hate group telling outright lie about transgender people and our life and the care that we get   Kupec said   I thought  maybe I should be challenging these five alarm fire we re seeing across the country    Other people are defining u instead of u defining ourselves  Through GRACE  Kupec help trans advocacy group around the country get their message out while providing them with research and data on issue like gender affirming care  We have a world where the left is shouting at the right and the right is shouting at the left   she said   We want to find that movable middle and appeal to their value and not have them see u a the enemy or the woke left  People have tried to portray these issue a partisan  and they re not  Climate prompt fear for personal safetyKupec and others say some politician have seized on transgender issue a a mean of distraction  trying to make up for lost vote over abortion right  This is purely political theater designed to capture attention   she said  noting a federal judge last year struck down a 2021 Arkansas law banning gender affirming care for trans youth  calling it unconstitutional and motivated by ideology   At the end of the day  the court are going to knock these thing down  because the medical evidence is overwhelming  Boyd Nelson  of Equality Ohio  said that while some politician might fixate on these issue to score point with their constituency  she wonder at what cost  Lives are at stake  and that s what s so disgusting about

ESTKeir Starmer ha angrily confronted Rishi Sunak in the Commons a the prime minister derided Labour s policy on transgender right after being told that the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey wa watching from the public gallery Starmer began his first question of PMQs by saying Esther Ghey wa watching the session  He wa scheduled to meet her afterwards  This week  the unwavering bravery of Brianna Ghey s mother  Esther  ha touched u all  As a father I can t even imagine the pain that she s going through  And I m glad that she s with u in the gallery here today   Starmer said Later  responding to a question from Starmer on the government s failure to cut hospital waiting list  Sunak said   It s a bit rich to hear about promise from someone who s broken every single promise he wa elected on  I think I counted almost 30 in the last year  pension  planning  peerage  public sector pay  tuition fee  childcare  second referendum  defining a woman   although in fairness that wa only 99  of a U turn  The list go on but the theme is the same  It s empty word  broken promise and absolutely no plan  Starmer ha previously said  99 9   of woman do not have penis  though Downing

man of integrity  When he s got absolutely no responsibility  Sunak ignored this in his next reply  When asked later in the session by Labour s Liz Twist to apologise to Brianna s mother  he ignored

worst of humanity  and she deserves all our admiration and praise   He did not apologise  however It is understood that while Sunak made the comment after being told Ghey wa watching  she actually arrived in chamber slightly late and so missed the initial exchange Downing Street afterward said the prime minister stood by what he said in the chamber  Sunak s press secretary said   It is legitimate in the house to be able point out the change in position the leader of the opposition ha made  Asked if the prime minister thought it wa acceptable to use trans people a the punchline to a joke  the press secretary said   I don t accept that characterisation  A Labour spokesperson said   We don t think that the country want or deserves a prime minister that is happy to use minority a a punch bag  The comment were really deeply offensive to trans people  and he should reflect on his response there and apologise  Sunak and his minister routinely attack Labour s position on transgender right  Last year the party changed it policy on a self identification system that would let people officially change their gender without a medical diagnosis Last Friday  Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe  both 16  were sentenced for murdering 16 year old Brianna after luring her to a park in Cheshire in February 2023  Ratcliffe wa found to have been partly motivated by hostility to Brianna s transgender identity Since the sentencing  when the killer were identified for the first time  Esther Ghey ha called for  empathy and compassion  towards their family  a  they too have lost a child  and  must live the rest of their life knowing what their child ha done  Jenkinson s family thanked Brianna s mother for her  incredible selflessness and empathy towards our family  Explore more on

definition of a woman  in the Commons a the mother of murdered trans teenager Brianna Ghey visited parliament The prime minister clashed with Sir Keir Starmer over the continuing trans debate at PMQs a Esther Ghey wa due to appear in the public gallery just four day after her 16 year old daughter s killer were jailed for life  Mr Sunak accused the opposition leader of being incapable of  defining a woman  and that it wa one of a number of issue on which he had performed a U turn But his jibe prompted howl of protest from MPs  who accused him of a  cruel  joke   shameful  behaviour and using minority a a punchline  After the heated clash  Labour called on Mr Sunak to apologise but Downing Street defended the prime minister s conduct  describing it a  legitimate  RecommendedCrass  tactless   could Rishi Sunak s trans blunder lose him the election The prime minister ha a politics problem   he isn t very good at itThink Sunak can magic a Major style win  Dream on   Outraged by the remark  Brianna s father Peter Spooner demanded an apology  saying he wa  disgusted  with Mr Sunak  before branding the comment  degrading  and  absolutely dehumanising  Brianna Ghey s mother Esther Ghey wa in parliament on Wednesday  PA The row deepened further when the business secretary Kemi Badenoch accused Labour of weaponising the issue for their political end  The incident is bound to be used by Mr Sunak s critic a further evidence that he is  tin eared    an allegation rejected by his ally The clash came a Mr Sunak accused the Labour leader of breaking pledge he wa elected on  adding that Sir Keir had U turned on  defining a woman  although  in fairness  that wa only 99 per cent of a U turn  The tone deaf remark were in reference to Sir Keir s previous comment that  99 9 per cent of woman do not have penis  An angry Sir Keir immediately admonished the Tory leader  He said   Of all the week to say that  when Brianna s mother is in this chamber  Shame  He accused the PM of  parading a a man of integrity when he ha got absolutely no responsibility   while shout of  shame  rang out from the backbench He added   I think the role of the prime minister is to make sure that every single citizen in this country feel safe and respected  and it s a shame the prime minister doesn t share that  It later emerged that Brianna s mother had not been in the Commons chamber when Sir Keir and Mr Sunak crossed sword  although both men were under the impression she wa Rishi Sunak wa criticised during PMQs  PA She arrived soon afterwards  however  Asked about the remark by Sky News later in the evening  Mr Spooner said   As the prime minister for our country  to come out with degrading comment like he did  regardless of them being in relation to discussion in parliament  they are absolutely dehumanising  Identities of people should not be used in that manner  and I personally feel shocked by his comment and feel he should apologise for his remark  The blunder is the latest in a series of political misstep from the PM  He wa criticised for betting Piers Morgan  1 000 that deportation flight to Rwanda would take off before the general election  and for an embarrassing moment when he laughed a a mother pleaded with him to cut NHS waiting list for her daughter  Mr Sunak did not apologise for his jibe  although at the end of PMQs  he did address Ms Ghey to praise her  compassion and empathy   reiterating that he thought she  demonstrated the very best of humanity in the face of seeing the very worst of humanity   Keir Starmer admonished the Tory leader for the remark  saying   Of all the week to say that  when Brianna s mother is in this chamber  Shame   UK Parliament YouTube Tory MP Jamie Wallis  the UK s first transgender MP  said Mr Sunak had been insensitive   I know from my own interaction with the prime minister that today s display of insensitivity must have been inadvertent  Today ha been a tough day for me but all I can think about right now is Brianna s mother  Let u all think of her a we choose how to progress with this debate  One former Conservative minister said they were appalled Tory backbencher Dehenna Davison said it wa  disappointing to hear joke being made at the trans community s expense  Our word     resonate right across our society  and we all need to remember that   Labour Party chair Anneliese Dodds said it wa not the first time the PM had  used LGBT  people a a punchline to a cruel joke   But she described his latest jibe a a  shameful new low  Labour s Jess Phillips called the prime minister  an absolute disgrace  On social medium site X  formerly Twitter  she wrote   Rishi Sunak is an absolute disgrace  Deplorable man with no heart  no sense  no clue  The sooner we are rid the better  She added   How dare he be so gross in the face of the family of a murdered child  He is the lowest of the low  Labour s Ben Bradshaw  one of the first openly gay MPs elected to parliament  called Mr Sunak a  disgusting man  and accused him of  making transphobic slur  No 10 defended Mr Sunak s remark a  legitimate  and did not rule out that he would use them again The prime minister s press secretary said it wa  legitimate  for Mr Sunak to  point out the number of U turn the leader of the opposition ha made   and said they did not accept the prime minister had used trans people a a punchline Sir Keir  who met Brianna s mother at her request  pledged his party would  work with campaigner and parent like Esther to ensure our child and young people have the mental health support they need  But Ms Badenoch hit back  saying   Every murder is a tragedy  None should be trivialised by political point scoring  As a mother  I can imagine the trauma that Esther Ghey ha endured  It wa shameful of Starmer to link his own inability to be clear on the matter of sex and gender directly to her grief   As Minister for Women and Equalities  I ve done all I can to ensure we have taken the heat out of the debate on LGBT issue while being clear about our belief and principle  Keir Starmer s behaviour today show Labour are happy to weaponise this issue when it suit them  In his Tory conference speech last year  Mr Sunak told Conservative delegate in Manchester   We shouldn t get bullied into believing that people can be any sex they want to be  They can t   a man is a man and a

decision to pursue transgender treatment should be reserved to adult alone  Puberty blocker for minor  I think we should protect child and their ability to make adult decision when they re adult   Poilievre said  I think we should protect the right of parent to make their own decision with regard to their child  Asked to state definitively if he s opposed to puberty blocker for people under the age of 18  Poilievre said he is Pierre Poilievre defends Alberta Premier Smith on transgender policiesThat s a step further than what Alberta Premier Danielle Smith ha proposed in her province Smith

describes a Smith s  anti LGBT  policy  which he said could lead to mental health trouble and an increase in suicidal thought among teen  The fact that Premier Smith and Pierre Poilievre want government to take away the option for parent and their vulnerable youth   in consultation with their doctor   to make the right decision for them is anchored in ideology and is not about protecting

before the onset of puberty for medical reason   and also because the puberty process is  an important experience through which young people may develop clearer understanding of their gender identity

deepen their voice  increase muscle mass and promote body and facial hair Trans woman sometimes use estrogen to increase breast size  reduce male pattern baldness and reduce testicle size The CPS say hormone therapy produce both reversible and irreversible change and should only be provided to young people who  demonstrate the capacity to understand and appreciate both the benefit and risk of

Poilievre came out against treating young people with puberty blocker   a position that prompted a broadside from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  Stephanie Taylor  The Canadian Press Feb 7  2024 4 15 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre talk to medium at a party caucus meeting on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday  Feb 7  2024  THE CANADIAN PRESS Sean Kilpatrick OTTAWA   The political battle line over gender identity came into sharper focus Wednesday a Pierre Poilievre came out against treating young people with puberty blocker   a position that prompted a broadside from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  The Conservative leader want to take away the right of parent and kid alike  Trudeau said after Poilievre finally clarified his stance on the controversial course of gender affirming therapy  Transgender child are much more likely to attempt suicide  Trudeau said  and government should not be contemplating way to take away their medical option  The prime minister also took a swipe at Alberta Premier Danielle Smith  who announced plan last week to ban puberty blocker and hormone therapy for child 15 and younger who have not already begun such treatment  Taking those option away from family and their doctor  is anchored in ideology and is not about protecting the most vulnerable   Trudeau said before question period   Our government will do whatever it take to protect the most vulnerable   Puberty blocker  a they re known  are used to prevent the body from producing the sex hormone that fuel both male and female development  The Alberta Medical Association ha released statement voicing concern over Smith s policy  saying transgender and gender diverse youth who lack access to such care face an increased risk of depression and suicide  Smith also proposes rule that would require parental consent for kid 15 and under who want to go by a different name or pronoun at school  Teens aged 16 and 17 would be able to make such change without permission  but school would have to notify their guardian  The proposal have spurred protest in Alberta and Ottawa and drawn condemnation from Liberal politician including Trudeau  who accuse Smith of pushing an anti LGBTQ  agenda  The proposition also triggered a barrage of medium question for Poilievre this week about his view on gender affirming medical treatment for transgender youth  Asked directly on Wednesday whether he opposes the use of puberty blocker for gender diverse youth under the age of 18  Poilevre said   Yes    We should protect child and their ability to make adult decision when they re adult   he said  For month  the federal Conservative leader ha said he support the right of parent to raise their child a they wish  and urged Trudeau to  butt out  of provincial decision about school and hospital  New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs wa the first provincial leader to change the notification policy in school for gender diverse child wishing to go by a different name or pronoun  Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe followed his lead last fall  Poilievre said it s the prime minister who is attacking family who are trying to protect their kid   He will  in the end  back down on this   he said   I think we should protect the right of parent to make their own decision with regard to their child  and I believe that adult should have the freedom to make any decision they want about their body   Liberal cabinet minister Randy Boissonnault  an openly gay MP who represents an Edmonton riding  paused before the party s weekly caucus meeting Wednesday to deride Poilievre s position  The decision to use puberty blocker should be based on a conversation between a young person and their doctor  Boissonnault said   I don t see M D  after Pierre Poilievre s name or Danielle Smith s   he said   So  not their business   NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh struck a similar tone  saying health care decision should involve an individual and their doctor   Based on evidence  based on science  based on best practice and not based on the opinion of Pierre Poilievre   The Canadian Paediatric Society recommended in a position statement last summer that health care provider should adopt an affirming approach to care for all child and youth and advocate for  timely access to specialized gender related care   The recommendation included ensuring that provider be sufficiently familiar with gender affirming hormone therapy to discus benefit and risk of that kind of intervention or ensure timely referral to people who can offer that advice  The executive director of Egale Canada  an LGBTQ  advocacy organization  said Poilievre and Smith are  playing politics with some of the most vulnerable member of our society   Helen Kennedy said in a written statement that the policy position run counter to expert guidance  violate the constitutional right of LGBTQ  people and  will lead to irreparable harm and suffering   Since becoming leader  Poilievre ha tried to keep his party focused on cost of living issue and crime   two area the party see a core to a winning strategy  Some of his supporter  however  have pressed him to veer further into the debate around how school handle issue of gender diversity and sexual orientation among their student  At last year s policy convention in Quebec City  grassroots party member voted overwhelmingly in favour of a resolution that call on a future Conservative government to prohibit  medicinal or surgical intervention  for gender diverse and transgender child  Poilievre ha yet to

group and individual that were consulted didn t reflect the majority of the 2SLGBTQ  community  They wish the premier had been present for the meeting to hear from community member who will be most affected by her decision  If she wa an active ally of our community  then she would have been in that meeting   Kih w said Kih w said they hope the government will continue to hear the voice of the

 they said  We re  a adult  trying to use our voice to speak up for the youth  but we should be   allowing them to speak for themselves  ABOUT THE AUTHORAaron SousaReporterAaron is a reporter with CBC

Central School District for allegedly treating her middle school daughter a a boy without parental knowledge or consent Jennifer Vitsaxaki took legal action on Wednesday after discovering the alleged deception  which took place during the 2020 2021 school year The complaint  filed in the U S  District Court for the Northern District of New York  alleges that school employee concealed from the mother that they had begun to treat her daughter a a boy  including being called a masculine name and using  they  and  them  pronoun When Ms  Vitsaxaki s daughter began to exhibit anxiety and depression and became reluctant to go to school  she turned to her daughter s teacher and school official  who repeatedly told the mother they hadn t noticed anything to worry about  Those repeated reassurance concealed the truth   lawyer from Alliance Defending Freedom wrote in the complaint However  during this time  teacher and school district official were  socially transitioning  Ms  Vitsaxaki s daughter and concealing this alleged fact from her mother  at the request of a school psychologist and per district policy  according to the complaint Related StoriesAlberta to Restrict

transitioning  the student without parental consent and concealing crucial information about her well being  the district violated Mrs  Vitsaxaki s fundamental parental right and her deeply held religious belief After a school counselor instructed staff to socially transition the girl by calling her a boy s name and using third person plural pronoun  a school psychologist who began to secretly meet with the girl without her mother s knowledge  told school staff to keep their action secret   No one informed Mrs  Vitsaxaki that the school district had made any of these decision   and taken all of these action toward her daughter   the complaint read Lawyers for Ms  Vitsaxaki stated in the complaint that the mother wa kept in the dark about her daughter s struggle with gender identity and the school official  effort to counsel her  This counseling included  sending her resource for medical transition   while the middle school girl s  mental condition got worse  The young girl resisted going to school  became anxious  and began to speak negatively about herself  Her mother became so desperate to find out what wa wrong that she took a job driving the school bus  By concealing from Mrs  Vitsaxaki this important information about her daughter  the School District betrayed Mrs  Vitsaxaki s trust  It also violated the U S  Constitution   the complaint read The lawsuit wa filed on behalf of the mother by Alliance Defending Freedom  whose senior counsel  Kate Anderson  said that the U S  Constitution grant parent the right to make decision about their child s upbringing  education  and health care  Parents  not the government  have the right to direct the upbringing  education  and health care of their child   Ms  Anderson said in a statement  Parents should be able to drop their kid off at school without fear that school staff will conceal critical information or cut them out of weighty decision with the potential for life long impact on their kid  Because school official concealed their action from Mrs  Vitsaxaki  they prevented her from helping her daughter at a time when she needed her mother s loving guidance most  Schools shouldn t hide important information from parent like Mrs  Vitsaxaki   Ms  Anderson added When Ms  Vitsaxaki confronted school official  they defended their action  citing district policy  according to her lawyer School official continued to call her daughter by a boy s name even after Ms  Vitsaxaki told them to stop and removed her from in person schooling to finish the school year online  according to the lawyer  The mother ultimately enrolled her daughter in a private school some 25 mile away The Epoch Times contacted the Skaneateles Central School

Editor Monday  February 05  2024Getty Images A mother is suing a school district in New York  alleging official treated her 12 year old daughter a though she wa a trans identified male and didn t disclose this attempted counseling to her Jennifer Vitsaxaki filed a complaint last week against the Skaneateles Central School District in the U S  District Court for the Northern District of New York  Syracuse Division According to the complaint  school official didn t inform Vitsaxaki that her daughter  identified a  Jane  in court document   wa experiencing bullying or that they were treating her daughter  a though she were a boy by referring to her with a boy s name  and using  they them  pronoun  Not one School District employee notified Mrs  Vitsaxaki or sought her consent before socially transitioning her daughter  Worse  although those employee knew about the School District s action  they told Mrs  Vitsaxaki nothing   the complaint argued  School staff carefully used Jane s given name and female pronoun when speaking with Mrs  Vitsaxaki  and they repeatedly said everything wa fine  all the while treating Jane a a boy and sending her resource for medical transition behind Mrs  Vitsaxaki s back  The lawsuit claim  Jane  continued to suffer from depression and anxiety during this time until her mother took her out of the public school and enrolled her in a private school in Syracuse  with her daughter s condition improving soon after This improvement ha included the daughter no longer wishing to identify a a boy or use plural pronoun and overall better mental health The new school is 25 mile away from the Vitsaxaki home  according to the complaint  and currently cost  12 660 a year in tuition fee  with the lawsuit calling these  the financial harm that the School District s action caused to Mrs  Vitsaxaki  Vitsaxaki is being represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom  a conservative legal group that ha won multiple religious freedom case before the U S  Supreme Court  Parents  not the government  have the right to direct the upbringing  education  and health care of their child   said ADF Senior Counsel Kate Anderson in a statement  The Skaneateles Central School District policy in this lawsuit betrays the trust of parent like Mrs  Vitsaxaki and violates their fundamental right  Not only that  it violates Mrs  Vitsaxaki s right to exercise her Christian faith by raising her daughter consistent with her sincerely held religious belief about human nature  gender  and identity  among other topic  In July 2015  the New York State Education Department issued guidance regarding the creation of  safe and supportive  school for  transgender and gender nonconforming student   The person best situated to determine a student s gender identity is the individual student   claimed the guidance   In the case of very young student not yet able to advocate for themselves  the request to respect and affirm a student s identity will likely come from the student s parent or guardian  The guidance note that while school official  should work closely with the student and family  regarding a  transgender status   there are case when  student do not want their parent to know about their transgender status   These situation must be addressed on a case by case basis and will require school to balance the goal of supporting the student with the requirement that parent be kept informed about their child   continued the 2015 document  The paramount consideration in those situation is the health and safety of the student and making sure that the student s gender identity is affirmed in a manner in which the level of privacy and confidentiality is maintained necessary to protect the student s safety  According to an updated guidance released last year  a student is  not required to obtain parental guardian consent or a court ordered name and or gender change before being addressed by their affirmed name and pronoun   Also  the state instructs school only to involve parent if  given permission by the student  Follow Michael Gryboski on Twitter or FacebookWas this article helpful Yes12 VotesNoHelp keep The

Margaret Olohan    MaryMargOlohan   January 31  2024 Twitter Facebook LinkedIn MeWe Parler Email Print FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL A New York school district socially transitioned a girl without her mother s consent  repeatedly lying to the mother about the child s mental health and social struggle  according to a new lawsuit  Represented by Alliance Defending Freedom  Jennifer Vitsaxaki of New York filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Skaneateles Central School District and Board of Education  accusing them of violating her constitutional right through their deception and their social transitioning of her 12 year old daughter  Jane  The Daily Signal first obtained the lawsuit  filed in U S  District Court for the Northern District of New York  Skaneateles  New York  where the school district is located  is about 22 mile southwest of Syracuse   Parents have the right to direct the upbringing and education of their kid  and they cannot fulfill those responsibility when school hide information from them and make critical decision that can have lifelong consequence for their child   said Kate Anderson  senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom   So  this case is important to ensure that all parent can have the information they need to do what s best for their kid   Though Michael Vitsaxaki and Jennifer Vitsaxaki are both U S  citizen  the Vitsaxaki family had spent almost a decade in Greece  where the Vitsaxaki parent were from  and Jane s primary language wa Greek  The family decided to leave Greece when it economy collapsed and they realized that they could not continue raising their child there  but the transition from their closely knit community in Greece to the U S  wa disruptive to the entire family s life  Young Jane Vitsaxaki had to adapt to a  new culture  including learning to go through each day speaking primarily English instead of Greek   and her father s job required him to frequently travel out of the country  The complaint state that Jennifer Vitsaxaki began to be increasingly concerned a her daughter wa exhibiting sign of anxiety and depression and occasionally refusing to leave home  The mother repeatedly asked school district employee about whether they had noticed anything troubling her daughter  but wa met with denial and assurance that her daughter wa fine   Those repeated reassurance concealed the truth   the complaint state   While school official kept telling Mrs  Vitsaxaki that there wa nothing to report  a school counselor wa regularly meeting with her daughter and her peer to address ongoing bullying suffered by   Jane  and other girl in the group   Worse than that  the complaint said  the district began treating Jane a though she were a boy  just a it had done with several other girl in her grade   01 2024 01 31 VvSCSD COMP Plaintiffs Verified Complaint TO FILEDownload  The same counselor instructed school staff to treat Mrs  Vitsaxaki s daughter a though she were a boy by referring to her with a boy s name and the third person plural pronoun  they  and  them  part of a controversial psychosocial intervention often called  social transition    the complaint state   Then  a school psychologist  who told school staff to keep their action secret from Mrs  Vitsaxaki  began meeting with Jane regularly without Mrs  Vitsaxaki s knowledge   No one had told Jennifer Vitsaxaki that the district had made any of these decision or taken these action   School staff carefully used Jane s given name and female pronoun when speaking with Mrs  Vitsaxaki  and they repeatedly said everything wa fine  all the while treating Jane a a boy and sending her resource for medical transition behind Mrs  Vitsaxaki s back   her lawsuit say  The district employee didn t tell Vitsaxaki about any of this for month  the lawsuit alleges  and Jane s mental condition worsened  She wa resisting going to school and becoming increasingly anxious and negative   At one point  and at her daughter s request  Mrs  Vitsaxaki even took a job a a bus driver to learn more about what could be causing her daughter s distress   the suit say  Finally  a staff member  could no longer stomach  the deception and urged the principal to tell Jane s mother   When  the principal  finally did  Mrs  Vitsaxaki wa shocked   the complaint say   She and her husband  Jane s father  met with representative of the school district  They directed the school district to stop taking any further action without their consent and sought open communication with the teacher to understand what had happened   It continued   But the principal told them school district policy required employee to deceive them  and despite assurance to the contrary  the deception continued  Left with no other option  Mrs  Vitsaxaki withdrew her daughter from the school district   Vitsaxaki s lawsuit stress that she ha a fundamental right to direct the upbringing  education  and health care of her child  a right that is  inconsistent with the deceptive  heavy handed  and disruptive intervention that the school district perpetrated against Mrs  Vitsaxaki s daughter an intervention that gravely interfered with her ability to raise her daughter and contradicted her religious belief    Ultimately  parent not school employee or other government official ought to decide how to resolve a child s question about sensitive topic like identity and gender confusion   the complaint say   Parents like Mrs  Vitsaxaki know their child better than anyone else  And parent  not school employee  will be there for a child in the long run

The Trans Movement And Being Used Nobody ever talked about  dyslexia    Jenner said   Some reporter asked me to do an interview on being dyslexic  Now  this is nine month after the game  I thought   I would love to do that   Maybe it s going to help some young kid out  you know  because nobody talked about it before   And so I did this interview  And in today s term  it went viral  Jenner said that the interview wa everywhere  and before you knew it dyslexia   which wasn t talked about previously   wa everywhere  Parents were going to their kid  and if they turn one word around  or they said something   parent would say    Oh my God  my child s dyslexic  I have to get help  I have to do something about it   And I see school for being dyslexic are opening up  psychologist or doing complete

everywhere  I mean  the cover of Vanity Fair started it   Jenner said That cover shattered record on Twitter  but Jenner soon started noticing that the story wa being co opted  I think in a lot of case  I have been used by the medium  by the left who s trying to push this   Jenner said  I have been used   So today it s the same thing  I feel the same way  Although  technically  I can t stop talking about it because there s a lot of thing that have to be done  But I think society ha to stop talking about it   she said  This is a small  small  small group of people  but it s a big meaty

against North Carolina s  Don t Say Gay  rule BPR News   By Laura Hackett Published February 5  2024 at 2 16 PM EST Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Asheville High School The Asheville City School board presides over about 4 000 student  including those at Asheville High School  This week  the Campaign for Southern Equality  a LGBTQ advocacy organization  filed a federal Title IX complaint in response to the harmful effect that they say State Bill 49 and House Bill 574 are having on North Carolina student  especially those who are transgender and gender nonconforming The 113 page complaint gathered testimonial from more than 20 student  parent  and school faculty  It alleged that public school are  systematically marginalizing lesbian  gay  bisexual  transgender  and queer student in violation of Title IX  SB 49  also known a the  Parent s Bill of Rights  or  Don t Say Gay Bill   wa passed by the General Assembly in August 2023  overriding a veto from Governor Roy Cooper  HB 574  a law that prohibits trans girl and woman from competing in female sport in public school  wa also passed through a similar veto override SB 49 strengthens parental control and censure discussion around LGBTQ  topic at public school  Specifically  it requires parental approval for mental health counseling  mandate school to notify a parent or guardian if their child change their name or pronoun  and ban instruction on gender identity or sexuality in kindergarten through fourth grade Schools across the state are approaching the law differentlyThe deadline for school district to comply with SB49 wa Jan  1  Some district  including Asheville City Schools and Buncombe County  have struggled with how to implement the law in a way that affirms LGBTQ  student Buncombe County Schools  the largest school system in Western North Carolina  approved implementation of the measure for it 45 school at the Dec  7 meeting Its policy requires parental notification when a student change their name or pronoun  but allows teacher to refer student to their principal first if they think the student isn t safe at home In the Triangle  the Chapel Hill Carrboro school board voted to not require parental notification for pronoun change or prohibit classroom discussion about gender identity  sexuality or sexual activity  a reported by the News   Observer The Asheville City School Board still hasn t agreed on how to interpret the law  In December  Board Chair George Sieburg told BPR that he belief the intent of the law is to  silence the voice of our student who are transgender or gender fluid   and that he hope the school board will be able to enact policy and procedure that  explicitly show we re going to support our student through this  Asheville City Schools ha postponed a vote on the law several time in the past few month  It now plan to hear public comment on Feb  5 and take a final vote on Feb  12 The complaint alleges a  hostile educational environment The complaint that Campaign for Southern Equality filed on Jan  31 alleges that the state s Board of Education and Department of Public Instruction are responsible for  barring LGBTQ affirming content  outing transgender student  erecting barrier to LGBTQ student receiving needed health care at school  These action create a  hostile educational environment  and violate Title IX s  obligation to provide every student with a safe and non discriminatory environment   the complaint alleged The Department of Public Instruction did not respond for comment Craig White  a spokesperson for the Campaign for Southern Equality  told BPR the complaint only  scratch the surface  of the SB49 s effect on student  As we receive testimony and hear story from all over the state  this situation is so much worse than what I expected   White said   The complaint  doesn t get into the way that this legislation  which target LGBTQ student  ha really empowered both adult and student to be bullying queer and trans kid  And that s happening in school district  whether they re progressive or conservative  We ve heard lot of report of bullying on the increase  He continued   And it s not surprising when the general assembly decides to target a specific group of people because of their identity that a lot of other bully and bigot are going to follow their lead  This is not the first time a local organization ha filed a Title IX complaint in response to SB49  In December  three local LGBTQ  advocacy organization  Youth Outright  Campaign For Southern Equality  and PFLAG Asheville   filed a local Title IX complaint to the Buncombe County School Board The board dismissed the complaint   citing lack of specificity  Buncombe s Title IX coordinator Shanon Martin wrote the complaint must  specify an alleged perpetrator or victim of sexual harassment  What s next The federal Office for Civil Rights and Department of Justice have a  pretty serious backlog   according to White  We don t know how long this process is going to take   he said   They will assign a federal civil right investigator to look into our allegation  And if they find that there is in fact discrimination and a violation of Title IX  then they will work with the  Department of Public Instruction  and the  State Board of Education  to remedy the harm and to come back into compliance   Tags News LGBTQ

Sault Ste  Marie Toronto Vancouver Vancouver Island Windsor Winnipeg Search CTVNews ca Search Edmonton  We won t accept   Hundreds spend weekend protesting new UCP policy aimed at trans youth Share Hundreds of protester gathered in Edmonton over the weekend to speak out against proposed legislation that would limit access to medical treatment for trans youth  LGBTQ2S  community member  activist and their ally gathered Saturday and Sunday to decry the UCP s recently announced policy regarding gender in school  sport and health care  At a Thursday press conference  Premier Danielle Smith said the rule are meant to protect trans and non binary youth  Trans Rights Yeg  who organized a rally in Old Strathcona Saturday  said the rule will only hurt young trans and non binary people   Hate is born in ignorance  and a governmental body is pushing a narrative that is misinformed  untrue and unjust   said Rowan Morris  of Trans Rights Yeg   It s hard enough to exist a a queer person  a a trans person in this world already  and I think that introducing legislation like this is really putting u backwards in term of where we should be going   said protester Megan Bohach  If the legislation pass  school would need to notify parent and get consent for student wanting to use a different name or pronoun  and trans girl and woman would not be allowed to compete in sport against biologically female athlete  The policy would also limit how and when trans and non binary youth can access gender affirming medical care like puberty blocking medication  hormone therapy or surgery  Zim Halldorson is 14 and identifies a non binary  They said they re scared of what the new rule might mean for their own health care journey   I want to be able to feel comfortable in my body   Halldorson said   Especially here in Alberta  it s not always the most welcoming place  so I wa really hoping to get on some of the gender  affirming treatment so I can be able to feel more happy   Smith said  under the new legislation  age limit on gender affirming health care would exist even in case where parent and medical professional have agreed on the treatment plan  New legislation from the UCP would prevent young people from accessing gender affirming puberty blocker  which the Canadian Pediatric Association considers a reversible and safe treatment for trans and non binary youth   Jeremy Thompson CTV News Edmonton Protester Liz Greenaway said Smith used  fear based rhetoric  when she announced the legislation   I just felt sick   she added   I have a trans kid  I would support them to the end of the earth    What the UCP is doing  and what  Smith s  doing   is making a marginalized group of people more vulnerable   Greenaway said  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the province s new policy the  most anti LGBT of anywhere in the country   Trans Rights Yeg belief the policy were created without consulting community member  teacher or trans youth  Premier Smith s office declined to comment on the protest Saturday and did not respond to question over the consultation process for the new legislation  Instead  Smith s press secretary reiterated that the police intend to  preserve the choice child and youth have before potentially making life altering and often irreversible adult decision   On Monday  at a press conference in Ottawa  she said   I think we have announced our intention on a number of policy item and we re going to be putting the architecture and legislation in place in the fall  so we ve got lot of time for consultation and we ll be able to get that feedback  But there are thing about the process that I do want to investigate just to make sure there is that level of rigour that ha been recommended  You are supposed to have a long period of time of counselling and living in the opposite gender  or the gender of choice  and just from some of the story I ve heard  I just need to make sure that process is being followed   So there ll be a bunch of consultation in the next number of month    We will continue fighting  A second protest wa held at the Alberta Legislature Sunday  High School teacher Kevin McBean said it wa encouraging to see hundred of people show up for the second day of demonstration   That give me hope and optimism  I hope that the government s listening when we tell them that this is not okay for trans kid  that we won t accept the danger they re putting trans life into   McBean said  Multiple medical professional  including doctor who specialize in treating trans youth  have called the policy harmful and questioned the reasoning behind them   A direct attack   Alberta s trans health lead protest new guideline Alberta doctor question science behind UCP s policy on health care for trans youth  It s devastating for the mental health of a young person who s struggling with this  for your identity   for your entire existence   to be questioned by every single person in the province   said Dr  Simone Lebeuf  an adolescent medicine pediatrician specializing in gender affirming care  on Friday   I have so many patient who have been extensively bullied  harassed  who ve been kicked out of their home   because of their gender identity  And this is just going to escalate all of that   Patrick Masse  a Canadian country music artist  wa at Sunday s protest  He lost a trans friend to suicide  He belief the policy announced by Smith will lead to more death in the community   People have the right to be who and how they are   Masse said    She  should not be speaking on these topic  because  she s  not an expert   Protesters gathered for the second day Sunday  Feb  4  to decry proposed legislation affecting trans and non binary Albertans   Brandon Lynch CTV News Edmonton Local politician joined in protest Saturday and Sunday  encouraging demonstrator to voice their concern to their local MLAs and MPs   We will continue fighting  but we need the tool   said NDP MLA Brooks Arcand Paul Saturday   We need letter from you  we need petition  we need thing that we can introduce into the legislature so we can fight this   Saturday  Alberta NDP leader Rachel Notley said the policy would take Alberta  back 50 year   Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault said Sunday that Smith s government should be focused on improving health care in her province and not  going after a minority community    The trans community  the queer community and our ally and champion are all standing up to say that Danielle Smith ha got the wrong side of this   said Edmonton MP Randy Boissonnault Sunday   She s trying to insert herself between youth and their family  between people and their doctor   Saturday  Smith s office confirmed the new legislation includes attracting more specialized

They re really fearful about what s coming with this  and they are scared about what it mean for them  and the ability to be themselves   Story continues below advertisement I hope the government is listening when we say this is not ok for trans kid  Liberal MP and Edmonton Centre representative Randy Boissonnault addressed the crowd  offering his support  I want to say to every transgender  questioning  gender diverse  queer person and their family and friend in this plaza who love them  we see you  we love you and we are there to defend and stand up with you   Boissonnault said  More on

why a a parent you have to support them  If you re not able to support your child then you need to ask yourself why  not take it out on the school system or go to the government to impose that for you  Last week  Smith said the government will require parental notification and consent if a child 15 year or younger change their name and pronoun at school She said parent of child aged 16 and 17 will not need to consent to the change but will need to be notified  Get the latest National news  Sent to your email  every day  Parents will also be given the choice to opt their child into classroom discussion and instruction on gender identity  sexual orientation or human sexuality  All third party material regarding these subject must be pre approved by the Ministry of Education  Story

they ve already started treatment In a statement to Global News on Sunday  a spokesperson for the Alberta government said   Some of the policy will be implemented through regulation and ministerial order  while others may need legislation  In addition  some policy implementation will require consultation and feedback from various stakeholder  The Premier and cabinet will work together through this process with the goal of having these policy fully implemented by the end of the year  More than 40 group across Alberta demanded the province to halt the proposed policy change in a joint statement issued on Saturday  saying the policy will disproportionately harm the transgender community The statement  signed by 47 advocacy organization and business across Alberta  called for an immediate halt to the policy  The group also called on the province to consult with the transgender community and for the creation of new regulation based on established medical practice and evidence  Hundreds of people protested the proposed policy in Edmonton and Calgary on Saturday  4 22 Protests against Alberta Premier Danielle Smith s sweeping new transgender policy in Calgary  Edmonton  The premier did a very good job of striking a balance   said David Oulton  television host on Out TV   These are very complicated  nuanced topic  People were asking for policy and asking for some kind of regulation to be implemented  and so I think she s managed to strike an appropriate balance   Story continues below advertisement  I think the nice thing that will come out of the policy  especially around teacher having to inform and get consent around pronoun  I think the beautiful thing that will come out of this is that it will force the conversation   Oulton continued   It kind of make sure that everyone in that child s village  so to speak  is there to support them and is there to uplift them  The premier did a really good job in that seven minute video of reiterating that you are loved  you are supported and we are here for you  Tiffany Gillis  a transgender Calgarian  appeared on the Roy Green Show Sunday and said she support the new policy and consulted with the premier on it  We went through each line of the draft policy a it existed at the time  which wa very similar to what wa released last week  and just went over whether there were any potential issue or thing that could have been worded better  I wa generally supportive of all of it   Gillis said  I don t think it s playing politics  It s a serious thing to go through  I struggled with gender dysphoria for a long time before I got help for it  But I know sometimes younger people aren t sure of who they are going to end up becoming  I ve explained it a couple of time this way  if you could promise me that this 13 year old who is identifying a trans will grow up to be a trans adult  then they would benefit from starting treatment earlier  The issue is that we really don t know for sure who is going to persist in their trans identity into adulthood and there s a lot of harm in treating people who turn out not to be trans and then de transition later on and go to regret it later on   Story continues below advertisement Gillis  who work in Alberta s oil and gas sector  said the majority of Albertans she s run into are supportive of trans people  I ve found that people are wholly supportive   Gillis added   Alberta and the oil industry are thing that get a bad rap  I meet with a lot of people in the industry a part of my job  I travel to small town around the province  I ve never felt

EDMONTON   Groups opposed to Alberta s planned policy around transgender youth held rally in Calgary and Edmonton over the weekend  with many of the attendee warning the plan will out trans kid and put their life in jeopardy  Seventeen year old Jaidyn Wolf  who travelled from Red Deer to a rally at the provincial legislature in Edmonton on Sunday  said he s had trans friend die by suicide and he want to speak out for other trans youth who don t have support at home   I started advocating at my school and it took getting the cop involved to stop the harassment that wa caused by me and my friend being outwardly trans and gay at our school   Wolf said  The new rule proposed by the province s United Conservative government include restriction on youth changing their name or pronoun at school and getting hormone therapy or gender reassignment surgery  Premier Danielle Smith ha said the change are to protect child from the consequence of choice they may later regret  and are also to preserve the role of parent  At a rally outside Calgary s city hall on Saturday  former mayor Naheed Nenshi called the video message in which Smith announced the move  cruelty    inhumane  and  un Albertan   Nenshi told the crowd that he d reassured a high school student last year that they were safe living in Alberta  but he doesn t feel that way after hearing Smith s policy announcement  Now he said he hate that he wa wrong   Premier Smith  I want you to understand that vote aren t worth a few dead kid   Nenshi said  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau criticized the proposed policy last week a well  calling them the  most anti LGBT of anywhere in the country   Smith ha said the fall sitting of the legislature would bring a ban on gender reassignment surgery for those 17 and under  There would be no puberty blocker or hormone therapy for the purpose of such surgery for anyone 15 and under  unless they ve already begun such procedure  Parental consent would be required for student 15 and under who want to change their name or pronoun at school  Students 16 and 17 would not need consent  but their parent would have to be notified  And the province would clamp down on transgender female athlete competing in woman s and girl  sport  Carrie Townsend  who identifies a a  non binary transgender  person  attended the Edmonton rally Sunday and said the policy announcement triggered feeling of grief and anger  Townsend  who grew up in Spruce Grove  west of Edmonton  said being a trans kid in the 1990s meant facing homophobia and queer phobia that they don t want kid to have to face anymore   I remember the silence around trans identity and queer identity  and I am here hopefully to fight so other child don t have to go through the same   Townsend said  New Brunswick and Saskatchewan have also enacted policy for young people questioning their gender  bringing in rule that require student 16 and younger to have parental permission to change their name or pronoun at school  Alberta say the current required age for genital reconstruction surgery is 18 and the required age for surgery on masculinization of the torso is 16  A court challenge in Alberta ha already been promised by two LGBTQ right advocacy group  Smith ha not ruled out using the notwithstanding clause in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to uphold the plan  Smith ha also said parent would have to be notified and give consent for their child to be taught about gender identity  human sexuality and sexual orientation  Third party resource material used to teach these subject from kindergarten through Grade 12 would have to be approved by the Education Ministry Many people at the rally on the weekend referred to Smith by her first name  Marlaina  instead of Danielle  which is her middle

Christian Post  Opinions expressed are solely those of the author s  HomeOpinionWhen the government come for your child By Michael Brown  Op ed Contributor Monday  February 05  2024Getty Images It s one of the ultimate nightmare  You find yourself living under a totalitarian regime which is militantly opposed to your personal belief and conviction  But you refuse to yield or cave in  To compromise is to lose your very soul  So  the government fight back   Go ahead   the authority say   and be a hero  But it will cost you dearly  We are taking away your child  As a reader  your first thought might be   Thank God we live in America  Well  think again What I described ha now taken place right here in the USA  the land of the free and the home of the brave Of course  thing like this have happened under communism for year  where the state remove child from Christian home and put them in government school to be indoctrinated and brainwashed A 2009 report on a homeschooling website stated that  The plight of German homeschoolers may have gotten worse  Despite rule regarding the freedom of movement in the European Union  German government official appear to have taken an unprecedented step of persuading French authority to take four child from a family who fled Germany to France in order to escape persecution aimed at homeschoolers  The headline itself wa chilling   German Homeschooled Children Seized by French Social Workers  A few year ago  a distraught mother living in a  progressive  country outside the US told me her own horror story Her 16 year old daughter had begun to identify a transgender  quite out of the blue  and without the parent  knowledge  the school informed her that if her parent were not supportive  the daughter could be removed from their home and raised in an affirming environment This mom and dad were shocked beyond word when they learned this from school authority  Who on earth gave them that right But what about here in America  where homeschooling is widely practiced  where there is not a totalitarian communist regime  and where there is le infringement on our private life  When is the government actually taking away anyone s child  other than because of case involving the real endangerment of the child Back in 2022  the Washington Examiner shared the heartbreaking story of Abby Martinez   who tried to fight back when a Los Angeles school  county social worker  and an LGBT group sought to transition her confused 15 year old daughter  But once Yaeli Martinez wa moved into foster care and later injected with testosterone  the heartbroken mother could only watch helplessly a the girl spiraled into depression that ended when she stepped in front of an oncoming train   They killed my daughter   a tearful Martinez told the Washington Examiner   They had to pick piece of her off of the track   You might say   But there were other factor involved in that story  and the government wa looking out for the child s best interest  The grieving mother would beg to differ  with every fiber of her being  And again  who empowered the state to make these kind of decision That s why there s such grave concern over a growing number of state   11 a of June 2023   declaring themselves sanctuary state for trans identified minor  Come here   they proclaim   and get the medical care that you need  the care that all those state that are withholding from you  We ll help you here  even without your parent  consent  And what happens to a trans identified minor child who make his or her way to one of these sanctuary state seeking trans related care  against their parent  wish  Does the sanctuary state now have legal authority over that child  Do the parent have a way to get their child back These are some of the very real  contemporary legal debate But rather than speculate  we can ask a couple in Montana what happened to their daughter As reported in the New York Post   The parent told Reduxx that their issue with the state agency started when official received a call in August 2023 that Jennifer  whose name wa changed for publication at their request  expressed suicidal thought at school  A CFS caseworker came to speak with the teen and inspect the house where Jennifer claimed she drank toilet bowl cleaner and took painkiller in an attempt to take her own life  the outlet reported  The teen reportedly showed no related symptom  and a test at the hospital showed she didn t consume any toxin  But her hospital stay stretched to multiple day  in which staff there noted that Jennifer identified a male and wanted to be called Leo  The parent said they quickly but unsuccessfully objected   We were very clear to the emergency room staff a well a  CFS  that this go against our value  moral and our religious belief   Krista Kolstad recalled to Reduxx  accusing the hospital of consistently undermining her and her husband s authority  And what happened next  Jennifer wa eventually moved to a specialized residential care facility in Wyoming despite her parent  concern  Kolstad told Reduxx she and Todd were worried about Jennifer being cared for in the state  where minor can receive gender affirming care without parental consent   They showed up at our home to serve u with paper to take Jennifer out of our care   Kolstad alleged   They told me the reason wa that we were  unable or refusing to provide medical care   That s just not true   Jennifer returned in September to a Montana youth facility  where she remains  Earlier this month  a court put the teen in the custody of CFS  Reduxx reported  Need I say more  other than that we ve been warning you that these day would come Do you believe me now Dr  Michael Brown  http   thelineoffire org   is the host of

state senate  and governor s office Ms  Smith said the bill would have violated parental right  increased the number of child gender transition  and likely have resulted in a flood of lawsuit from parent whose child were taken away to Maine for child gender transition It is almost certain Democratic Maine legislator will brave those hazard at a later date  she said Many Maine Democrats see allowing child gender transition a a moral issue on par with ending segregation  Ms  Smith said  They certainly do believe that   she said The Epoch Times contacted the bill s sponsor  state Rep  Laurie Osher  a Democrat  but received no comment by publication time Ms  Osher provided written testimony supporting the bill  in which she say there s  a coordinated national attack on gender

her daughter to a pediatrician  who said signing her daughter up for gender transition surgery now would help her get through the long wait list for the procedure  By the time she s 18 to make her own choice  then she won t have to wait on the waitlist   the pediatrician said  Ms  Lawson said she refused this offer Today  her daughter no longer wonder if she is a man  Ms  Lawson said Transgender

Hundreds of Albertans took to the street in Calgary and Edmonton Saturday to show their support for the transgender community  The massive protest come day after controversial provincial policy were unveiled that will limit access to medical treatment for trans youth  LGBTQ2S  community member  activist and their ally gathered to demand the UCP government roll back those legislation proposal that deal with gender in school  sport and health care   You just hope the  government  is actually listening   Calgary protester Alyssa Quinney said   We would all rather be anywhere else  but here we are   At a Thursday press conference  Premier Danielle Smith said the rule are meant to protect trans youth and offer their parent more peace of mind  But her announcement ha been met with swift opposition across the country   specifically from people arguing the proposal are going to have the exact opposite effect  Many in Calgary call the move political posturing meant for the fringe of Smith s base    Parental right  is a big blanket umbrella term being used to get people fired up about a non issue   parent Victoria Desjardins told CTV News   It speaks to the fact that the UCP doesn t know what the majority of Albertans want   Leah Zurbrigg added  Roughly 1 200 people gathered in Calgary  including representative from city council  the Alberta NDP  the Alberta Teachers  Association and more  Cardinal policy So just how did we get here  On Thursday  Smith said she had help in creating the new proposal   I ve been very influenced over many year talking to many individual in the transgender community   she said   I met with Lois Cardinal  who  a you may know  ha felt that she wa rushed into bottom surgery and is having consequence of that   CTV News caught up with Cardinal this weekend  She say she came out and began transitioning at 19 year old  Two year later   at 21   she wa approved for surgery and flown to Montreal  She say she felt  pushed through  the system and is angry doctor didn t stop her  Cardinal now refers to herself a being  sterilized    I had several complication with vaginoplasty and also with a neurological condition   she said   I wa at a breaking point   Cardinal ha met with Smith and been mentioned by the premier multiple time  She s on board with the proposed change   What we are giving  kid  is time   she said   There s no rush   It s such a personal experience  and I think loving parent and guardian should be involved   At least partially inspired by Cardinal  Smith say she want to make sure the post op experience is improved  That s especially where Cardinal say she felt let down once she returned home   We want to attract somebody into our province who can do the surgery here   Smith said Thursday   So the aftercare can be done here   Not the same  CTV News asked multiple protestors on Saturday about Cardinal s impact on the premier  Jake Donaldson  who is a family physician  say he feel for the Saddle Lake resident   Unfortunately  regret is just a reality of life   Donaldson said   What we re weighing is the risk of regret for these young individual versus the risk of doing nothing and forcing them through a puberty that doesn t match their gender identity   And there are multiple marked difference between Cardinal s story and the story of those who will be impacted by what Smith ha brought forward  Firstly  Cardinal wa 21 when she transitioned  no longer a child who needed parental supervision  And though she feel rushed  many younger teen in the gender affirming process have even longer than two year to figure out what they want  Alberta s current system ha a lengthy waitlist and backlog  and surgery are reserved for adult only  Lastly  the data suggests Cardinal is an outlier  Multiple North American study   including a report out of Princeton University in 2022   show the overwhelming majority of those young people who transition stick with it  Donaldson say it s unfair to colour the policy with one case   People regret having kid   he said   And getting tattoo  We re not going to ban those   Smith is expected to turn the proposal into legislation this autumn

com yNuZyt3HRK  Libs of TikTok   libsoftiktok  August 30  2023 The X post attracted the attention of Oklahoma State Schools Superintendent Ryan Walters  who immediately called for the 52 year old Murnan to resign and began an investigation of Murnan s teaching certificate and the district s hiring practice  According to Walters  parent were immediately upset by the revelation   I ve heard from parent in Western Heights and throughout Oklahoma who are deeply concerned about the message being sent by a district that would put a drag queen in charge of one of our school  It is simply unacceptable   Walters said in announcing the investigation   Mr  Murnan ha been clear that he is  very open  about his alter ego and ha shared it not only on publicly available social medium but ha performed in public library under a very thin veil of would be anonymity  These are not the action of a school leader concerned about the well being of child   Initially  at least  the school district supported Murnan amid the backlash   Recently  information began circulating about Dr  Murnan and the charge he faced more than 20 year ago for an alleged crime involving child pornography  According to news report at the time  those charge were dismissed by the court  and the record of the charge ha been expunged   read a district statement from superintendent Brayden Savage   Since that time  Dr  Murnan ha continued to be certified a an elementary school teacher and principal  including having his certificate renewed in April of 2023 and signed by State Superintendent Ryan Walters  The State Department of Education would have conducted another felony background check upon renewing his certification   According to Murnan  the district s support began to wane after a meeting between Savage and Walters in December  and he wa given an ultimatum to resign or be fired   It really make me angry because all this time   Savage  told me she wa supporting me and she wasn t going to fire me   Murnan said on NonDoc   She supported me multiple time with multiple people a witness in the room  And then she  said  I have a choice to be terminated or resign   Drag queen don t belong in the classroom  This is common sense   libsoftiktok pic twitter com Efnk3yOeuj  Superintendent Ryan Walters   RyanWaltersSupt  February 2  2024 But Walters say Murnan s departure from the school  whether forced or not  is necessary   Exposing Murnan and forcing the resignation is a necessary step to protect kid in Oklahoma  Our student will be protected from predatory behavior  and I have been crystal clear that I will not allow Oklahoma school to become a training ground in drag queen propaganda   Walters said  Walters recently appointed Chaya Raichik  the founder of Libs of TikTok  to the

league s all star weekend  The NHL  Scotiabank and Pride Tape hosted player from the Toronto Gay Hockey Association competing in a ball hockey game at Metro Toronto Convention Centre on Saturday morning ,Center,High Factuality,Bell Media,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/ference-feels-nhl-making-progress-with-support-of-lgbtq-2s-community-1.6754654?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral,Media Conglomerate,Ference feel NHL making progress with support of LGBTQ 2S community Share TORONTO   Andrew Ference feel the NHL ha made progress in it support of the LGBTQ  community  The former defenceman and the NHL s director of social impact  growth and fan development wa in attendance for the first Pride Cup at the league s all star weekend  The NHL  Scotiabank and Pride Tape hosted player from the Toronto Gay Hockey Association competing in a ball hockey game at Metro Toronto Convention Centre on Saturday morning   The overwhelming majority of hockey player and people in the locker room are incredibly supportive and incredibly proud to support cause like this and many great positive cause within the hockey community   he said  adding that  there s always a social cost  with freedom to have one s own view regarding the continued ban on theme night pre game jersey   So I think like anything in life when you live in a free country  and in North America  you re going to have different viewpoint  You re not always going to agree with them and that s OK   But I think within hockey  we see the overwhelming support for this community and that s incredibly encouraging for me   Top sport headline  all in one place The NHL received backlash last year when it halted the theme night pre game jersey for the 2023 24 season last June  It wa a result of a handful of player refusing to wear Pride jersey for differing reason and that causing a distraction from the league s view  It then issued an updated memo last October which included a ban on Pride Night tape for pre game warm ups that brought along further criticism  The NHL then rescinded the ban on the tape  saying player had the choice to support cause with stick tape throughout the season  Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid and Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly were among those who spoke out in disagreement to the league s move in 2023  Arizona Coyotes defenceman Travis Dermott proceeded to go against the ban on Oct  21  leading to the league rescinding the ban on the stick tape three day later   There s always going to be more to be done  there s always going to be room for more support  more progress   Ference said   But sometimes it s baby step  Culture change  sometimes  frustratingly slow and especially sometimes in sport   You deal with that and I think if you do the right thing  you support good people and you support proud  strong community in hockey  you re always on the right side of history   Longtime NHL executive and current executive director of the Professional Women s Hockey League Players  Association  Brian Burke  who ha long been a strong supporter of the LGBTQ  community  had called the ban a  surprising and serious setback  at the time  On Saturday  however  he had a different tune    NHL Commissioner  Gary Bettman s been a great ally  I think people are focused on the fact that they got rid of Pride sweater   Burke said Saturday   They still do Pride Nights  just not the Pride sweater  The league s been an ally  We haven t got everything we d like from the league but we get great support   I think we just keep going the way we re going and keep adding event  keep adding awareness  keep changing and breaking down the barrier that constrict u   he added   I see the world a a very different place than when my son came out    We ve made great gain and we got to keep focusing on that and not what hasn t happened   Pride Tape co founder Dr  Kristopher Wells found Saturday s event to be a way of fixing the NHL s standing with the community   This is about repairing harm that ha been done to the community   Wells said   The Pride Tape ban hurt a lot of people and that s why you saw the worldwide response about that decision   So I hope that Pride Cup is a start of building a new relationship  One where we re all working together because at the end of the day  the young people who love hockey  they want the game to love them back   Bettman wa on hand Saturday to present the Pride Cup trophy to the winning side and a  25 000 cheque to the Toronto Gay Hockey Association  Burke and Ference served a coach to the team  while PWHL

 Ference feel the NHL ha made progress in it support of the LGBTQ  community  The former defenceman and the NHL s director of social impact  growth and fan development wa in attendance for the first Pride Cup at the league s all star weekend  THE CANADIAN PRESS Kayle Neis  So I think like anything in life when you live in a free country  and in North America  you re going to have different viewpoint  You re not always going to agree with them and that s OK   But I think within hockey  we see the overwhelming support for this community and that s incredibly encouraging for me   The NHL received backlash last year when it halted the theme night pre game jersey for the 2023 24 season last June  It wa a result of a handful of player refusing to wear Pride jersey for differing reason and that causing a distraction from the league s view  It then issued an updated memo last October which included a ban on Pride Night tape for pre game warm ups that brought along further criticism  The NHL then rescinded the ban on the tape  saying player had the choice to support cause with stick tape throughout the season  Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid and Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly were among those who spoke out in disagreement to the league s move in 2023  Arizona Coyotes defenceman Travis Dermott proceeded to go against the ban on Oct  21  leading to the league rescinding the ban on the stick tape three day later   There s always going to be more to be done  there s always going to be room for more support  more progress   Ference said   But sometimes it s baby step  Culture change  sometimes  frustratingly slow and especially sometimes in sport   You deal with that and I think if you do the right thing  you support good people and you support proud  strong community in hockey  you re always on the right side of history   Longtime NHL executive and current executive director of the Professional Women s Hockey League Players  Association  Brian Burke  who ha long been a strong supporter of the LGBTQ  community  had called the ban a  surprising and serious setback  at the time  On Saturday  however  he had a different tune    NHL Commissioner  Gary Bettman s been a great ally  I think people are focused on the fact that they got rid of Pride sweater   Burke said Saturday  They still do Pride Nights  just not the Pride sweater  The league s been an ally  We haven t got everything we d like from the league but we get great support    I think we just keep going the way we re going and keep adding event  keep adding awareness  keep changing and breaking down the barrier that constrict u   he added   I see the world a a very different place than when my son came out    We ve made great gain and we got to keep focusing on that and not what hasn t happened   Pride Tape co founder Dr  Kristopher Wells found Saturday s event to be a way of fixing the NHL s standing with the community  Winnipeg Free Press   Newsletter Business Weekly Monday

This is about repairing harm that ha been done to the community   Wells said   The Pride Tape ban hurt a lot of people and that s why you saw the worldwide response about that decision   So I hope that Pride Cup is a start of building a new relationship  One where we re all working together because at the end of the day  the young people who love hockey  they want the game to love them back
