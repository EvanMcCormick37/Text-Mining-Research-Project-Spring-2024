    "Association Rule Mining (ARM) is an analysis tool for finding out if certain items in a dataset 'go together'-- i.e. if they are often seen next to each other in an observation. ARM is on 'transaction datasets', datasets where each observation is treated as a group of items. Transaction datasets are similar to word-document matrices, but with some key distinctions. In transaction datasets:\n",

    "    1. Order of items doesn't matter.\n",
    "    2. Frequency of items also doesn't matter, with the exception of 0.\n",

    "In transaction data, each document is considered a set of words, where either a word is present in the document or it isn't. How often a word appears isn't relevant in this data. To perform ARM analysis on my text data, I'll first have to convert it to a transactional dataset."

Firstly, it's noticing the Brianna Ghey killing as a distinct set of stories, and picking up the words making up those headlines. It's also revealing a common headline about pushes to 'ban genderaffirming care', and the ohio bill which was vetoed by the Ohio governer. We can see the supreme court getting shoutouts in fome of these stories too, and of course there's the high-school bathroom bill which is the subject of some stories, and is probably responsible for the pairs 'high->school' and 'student->bathroom'.\n",

    "It looks like the most common rules in the dataset have to do with the associations with 'gender' and 'transgender'. This tracks, given the overall topic of the dataset is ***transgender***. However, these connections also give us a sense of what people in the news associate **transgender** with. Some of the associated words are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    added, people, year, life, told, policy, just, want\n",
    "\n",
    "while the associations with **gender** include\n",
    "\n",
    "    identity, policy, law, government, right, child, state\n",
    "\n",
    "Frankly, these sets of words provide better connotations with transgender and gender than I can hope to create. If I attempted to summarize them, I would in fact be doing the opposite. I guess I'll try anyways: The **transgender** associations seem to relate to a recent push by transgender people to change policy this year. There are time related words, words signifying desire, and action words like `told` and `added`. Meanwhile, the words associated with **gender** indicate that gender is somewhat dictated by government and law, but is also considered a personal identity and a right.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with these rules is that while they are prevalent, they aren't very strong. `Lift` is a measure of how strongly correlated two more terms are in a text, i.e. how much one of the terms being present raises the probability of another term occurring. Lift is commonly used to check the validity of associations in ARM, with a high lift indicating that the terms truly are linked to one another, and a lift of 1 indicating that the terms are in fact, not correlated with each other at all. While the rules I inspected so far have a lot of support, they don't have a great amount of lift, with lift scores ranging between `1.1` and `1.6`. So...\n",
